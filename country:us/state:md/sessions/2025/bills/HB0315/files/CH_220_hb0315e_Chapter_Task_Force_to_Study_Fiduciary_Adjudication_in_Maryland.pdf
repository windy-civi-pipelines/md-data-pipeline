AN ACT concerning
Task Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in Maryland
FOR the purpose of establishing the Task Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in
Maryland to examine and analyze the efficiency, uniformity, and quality of fiduciary
adjudication in Maryland and make recommendations; requiring the orphans’
courts, circuit courts, registers of wills, and Administrative Office of the Courts to
comply with certain requests of the Task Force; and generally relating to the Task
Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in Maryland.
Preamble
WHEREAS, In 2022, the Task Force to Study the Maryland Orphans’ Courts issued
a report identifying certain inefficiencies and other problems with the selection of judges
for, and adjudication of matters before, the orphans’ courts; and
WHEREAS, More recent developments have further illustrated those problems,
including the lack of uniformity in probate adjudication across Maryland’s jurisdictions;
and
WHEREAS, The adjudication of other fiduciary matters, including those relating to
trusts and adult guardianships, involve overlapping issues with probate matters and can
be more efficient; and
WHEREAS, Maryland created the orphans’ courts in 1777 in order to assist families
with the transmission of wealth on a member’s death; and
WHEREAS, In the ensuing 248 years, methods for holding and transmitting wealth
have changed significantly, and probate and fiduciary legal issues have become
substantially more complex; and
WHEREAS, The General Assembly recognizes the value that a specialized court
brings to families in times of transition; and
WHEREAS, The General Assembly also recognizes the need for further changes to
fiduciary adjudication in Maryland in order to provide a uniform and efficient system for
its citizens; now, therefore,
SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
That:
(a) There is a Task Force to Study Fiduciary Adjudication in Maryland.
