7 Preamble
8 WHEREAS, In 2022, the Task Force to Study the Maryland Orphans’ Courts issued

12 including the lack of uniformity in probate adjudication across Maryland’s jurisdictions;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, The adjudication of other fiduciary matters, including those relating to
15 trusts and adult guardianships, involve overlapping issues with probate matters and can
16 be more efficient; and
17 WHEREAS, Maryland created the orphans’ courts in 1777 in order to assist families
18 with the transmission of wealth on a member’s death; and
19 WHEREAS, In the ensuing 248 years, methods for holding and transmitting wealth
20 have changed significantly, and probate and fiduciary legal issues have become
21 substantially more complex; and
22 WHEREAS, The General Assembly recognizes the value that a specialized court
23 brings to families in times of transition; and
