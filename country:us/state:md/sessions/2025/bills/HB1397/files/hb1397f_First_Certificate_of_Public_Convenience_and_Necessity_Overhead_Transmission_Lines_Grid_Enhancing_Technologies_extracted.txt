12 (ii) “Construction” does not include a change that is needed for the
13 temporary use of a site or route for nonutility purposes or for use in securing geological
14 data, including any boring that is necessary to ascertain foundation conditions.
15 (4) “Generating station” does not include:
16 (i) a generating unit or facility that:
17 1. is used for the production of electricity;
18 2. has the capacity to produce not more than 2 megawatts of
19 alternating current; and
20 3. is installed with equipment that prevents the flow of
21 electricity to the electric grid during time periods when the electric grid is out of service;
22 (ii) a combination of two or more generating units or facilities that:

26 2. are located on the same property or adjacent properties;
27 3. have the capacity to produce, when calculated

10 failure or when there is equipment failure at a site where critical infrastructure is located;
11 and
12 B. test and maintenance operations necessary to ensure
13 functionality of the generating unit or facility in the event of a service interruption from

5 any surface mining area;
6 2. land excavations;
7 3. workings; and
8 4. overburden.
9 [(6)] (7) “Qualified generator lead line” means an overhead transmission
10 line that is designed to carry a voltage in excess of 69,000 volts and would allow an
11 out–of–state Tier 1 or Tier 2 renewable source to interconnect with a portion of the electric
12 system in Maryland that is owned by an electric company.
13 (f) For the construction of an overhead transmission line, in addition to the
14 considerations listed in subsection (e) of this section, the Commission shall:

2 line is proposed to be constructed on:
3 (i) an existing brownfields site;
4 (ii) property that is subject to an existing easement; or
