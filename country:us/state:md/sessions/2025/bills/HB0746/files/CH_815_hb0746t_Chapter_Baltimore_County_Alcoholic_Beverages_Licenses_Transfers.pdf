to another location.
4. The applicant may submit information to the Board in
support of the transfer of the license.
(iv) The Board may waive the requirement under subparagraph (ii)3

efforts to facilitate a future use of the property and mitigate any negative economic impacts
to the surrounding community.
(c) (6) A Class B or D license transferred under subsection [(a)] (B) of this
section or a Class B Service Bar (SB) license issued under this subsection may not
thereafter be transferred from the licensed premises or converted to another class of license.
(e) (2) Subject to the 25% allowance authorized in subsection [(a)(1)(ii)]
(B)(1)(II) of this section, the Board shall consider a license transferred under this section
to be a regular license and not an exception license for determining the total number of
licenses available in an election district based on the rule of the Board.

1, 2025.
