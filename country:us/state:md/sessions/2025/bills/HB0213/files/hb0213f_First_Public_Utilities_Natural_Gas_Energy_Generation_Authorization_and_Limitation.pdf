6 FACE CHALLENGES IN THE SHORT TERM IN MEETING THE STATE’S GROWING
7 ENERGY NEEDS SOLELY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES;
8 (3) TO ENSURE ENERGY RELIABILITY AND SECURITY, IT IS
9 NECESSARY TO TEMPORARILY ALLOW THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENERGY
10 GENERATING SYSTEMS THAT PRODUCE ENERGY FROM NATURAL GAS WHILE
11 ENERGY CAPACITY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES CONTINUES TO GROW;
12 AND
13 (4) NATURAL GAS PROVIDES A MORE RELIABLE AND LOWER–CARBON
14 ALTERNATIVE COMPARED TO COAL AND OIL, OFFERING A TRANSITIONAL SOLUTION
15 AS THE STATE WORKS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG–TERM CLIMATE AND ENERGY GOALS.
16 (B) NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF LAW, AND SUBJECT TO
17 SUBSECTIONS (C), (D), (E), AND (F) OF THIS SECTION, ENERGY GENERATING
18 SYSTEMS THAT PRODUCE ENERGY FROM NATURAL GAS MAY BE CONSTRUCTED,
19 PERMITTED, AND OPERATED UNTIL THE STATE REACHES THE GOAL OF MEETING
20 100% OF ITS ENERGY NEEDS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES, INCLUDING
21 NUCLEAR ENERGY.
22 (C) A PERSON CONSTRUCTING AN ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM UNDER
23 THIS SECTION SHALL COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SUBTITLE RELATING
24 TO REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN:

32 (II) WHEN A PERSON APPLIES FOR APPROVAL UNDER
33 SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OF THIS PARAGRAPH, THE PERSON SHALL PROVIDE TO THE

HOUSE BILL 213 3
1 DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT A TRANSITION PLAN OUTLINING HOW THE

5 RESOURCES.
6 (2) (I) THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT SHALL REVIEW
7 AND APPROVE OR DENY AN APPLICATION FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW

9 (II) IN APPROVING OR DENYING AN APPLICATION SUBMITTED
10 UNDER THIS SUBSECTION, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT SHALL
11 CONSIDER:
12 1. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE SYSTEM; AND
13 2. WHETHER THE SYSTEM IS NECESSARY TO MEET THE
14 STATE’S ENERGY NEEDS.
15 (E) AN ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES ENERGY FROM
16 NATURAL GAS SHALL USE THE BEST AVAILABLE EMISSIONS CONTROL
17 TECHNOLOGIES TO MINIMIZE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.
18 (F) (1) AN ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES ENERGY
19 FROM NATURAL GAS MAY NOT BE CONSTRUCTED, PERMITTED, OR OPERATED AFTER
20 THE STATE REACHES THE GOAL OF MEETING 100% OF ITS ENERGY NEEDS FROM
21 RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES.
22 (2) WITHIN 10 YEARS AFTER THE STATE REACHES THE GOAL OF
23 MEETING 100% OF ITS ENERGY NEEDS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES,
24 EACH ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES ENERGY FROM NATURAL GAS
25 SHALL BE:
26 (I) DECOMMISSIONED; OR
27 (II) TRANSITIONED TO A SYSTEM THAT PRODUCES ENERGY
28 SOLELY FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES.
29 (G) ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 31 EACH YEAR, THE COMMISSION, IN
