2025 Session
HB0487
Unhoused Individuals - Rights, Civil Action, and Affirmative
Defense
Bill Summary
This bill establishes that unhoused individuals have certain rights relating to engaging in
“life-sustaining activities.” The bill prohibits certain governmental entities, officials, or agents
from imposing specified penalties for exercising a right established under the bill or for offering
aid to unhoused individuals on or about public places. The bill also authorizes the Attorney General
or an individual harmed by a violation of the bill’s provisions to bring a civil action against
governmental entities, officials, or agents. Furthermore, the bill establishes an affirmative defense
of necessity for certain criminal prosecutions relating to trespass or disturbing the peace. Finally,
the bill repeals the authority of a municipality to prohibit vagrancy. The provisions of the bill must
supersede any local law or ordinance comparable in subject matter except to the extent that the
local law or ordinance provides broader applicability or more protections for unhoused individuals
than the bill.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill aims to prevent the criminalization of homelessness and ensure that unhoused individuals
are treated equitably under the law by affirming certain rights relating to “life-sustaining
activities,” establishing rights to initiate civil actions, creating a “necessity defense,” and repealing
specified vagrancy laws. While all unhoused individuals in the State will likely benefit from the
bill’s changes, Black individuals will likely be positively impacted to the largest extent as they are
significantly overrepresented in Maryland’s unhoused population. Data from the Department of
Housing and Community Development (DHCD) shows that Black individuals accounted for 57%
of the State’s unhoused population in 2024. The overall impacts of the bill would depend greatly
on how its provisions are implemented.

Analysis
Established Rights of Unhoused Individuals
The bill establishes that all unhoused individuals have the right to:
 be on or about “public places” within the State without being discriminated against on the
basis of actual or perceived housing status;
 engage in life‐sustaining activities on or about public places, provided that such activities
do not obstruct the normal movement of pedestrian or vehicular traffic in such a manner
that creates a hazard to others, unless an “adequate alternative indoor space” is available
and has been offered to the individual, including transportation for the individual and the
individual’s belongings;
 use and move freely in public places without being discriminated against on the basis of
actual or perceived housing status;
 privacy in personal property stored on or about public places to the same extent as personal
property stored in a private dwelling;
 pray, meditate, worship, or practice religion on or about public places without being
discriminated against on the basis of actual or perceived housing status;
 occupy a motor vehicle or recreational vehicle parked on or about a public place that is not
obstructing the normal movement of traffic;
 relocate a motor vehicle or recreational vehicle being used for life‐sustaining activities
prior to receiving a parking ticket or the vehicle being towed;
 retrieve items from a towed motor vehicle or recreational vehicle; and
 reclaim a towed motor vehicle or recreational vehicle from storage free of charge or at a
reduced rate upon consideration of the individual’s ability to pay any costs.
Restrictions on Civil and Criminal Penalties
The State, an agency of the State, a political subdivision of the State, or an official or agent of the
State, an agency of the State, or a political subdivision of the State acting under color of law may
not (1) impose a civil or criminal penalty against an unhoused individual for exercising a right
described above or (2) impose a civil or criminal penalty against any individual for soliciting,
sharing, accepting, or offering food, water, money, or other donations to unhoused individuals on
or about public places.
Established Rights to Civil Actions and Defenses of Necessity
Under the bill, an individual harmed by a violation of the rights described above may initiate a
civil action against the State; an agency, agent, or official of the State; or a political subdivision of
the State that implements or enforces a limitation or requirement in violation of the bill’s
provisions. The bill also authorizes the Attorney General, on behalf of the residents of the State,
to initiate civil action against a governmental unit that implements or enforces a limitation or
requirement that violate provisions of the bill.
HB 487/ Page 2

The bill also establishes an unhoused individual ’s right to a “defense of necessity” upon facing
charges like trespassing or disturbing the peace, which may be asserted if (1) the defendant
committed the alleged criminal act while engaging in a life-sustaining activity and (2) the
defendant, at the time of committing the criminal act, did not have access to an adequate alternative
indoor space. In recognition that homelessness may force individuals into situations where they
must act in ways that would otherwise be considered illegal due to lack of alternative options, this
affirmative defense provides legal protections to discourage excessive criminalization of life
sustaining activity.
Finally, the bill repeals a municipality’s authority to prohibit vagrancy, which includes acts like
sleeping in public, loitering, and begging/panhandling. This provision aims to mitigate the
criminalization of homelessness that would further exacerbate one’s ability to access stable and
adequate housing due to a criminal record and/or unpayable legal fees.
Homelessness in Maryland
DHCD and the Interagency Council on Homelessness report that the primary contributing factors
of homelessness are a combination of low wages and a lack of available, affordable, or adequate
housing. Low income relative to the cost of living, disabling conditions, domestic violence, and
sudden income loss are all common issues that result in loss of housing.
Income and renter data from the U.S. Census Bureau and DHCD suggests that the link between
high housing costs and homelessness is real and persistent. The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023
American Community Survey reported that nearly half of all renters in the country were
cost-burdened, meaning they spent more than 30% of their income on housing costs. This cost
burden was higher among Black renters at 56%.
State-level data reflects the national data, as DHCD reported that over 50% of Maryland renters
were considered cost-burdened in 2020. Exhibit 1 shows the racial and ethnic breakdown of the
cost-burden data for renters in Maryland compared to their portion of the State’s population. While
a significant number of all Maryland renters are cost-burdened to some degree, Hispanic and Black
renters experience this at disproportionate levels when compared to their shares of the State’s
population. The data also shows that Black and Hispanic renters also have slightly higher levels
of households that are “severely cost-burdened,” meaning that they spend more than 50% of their
income on housing. The severely cost-burdened rate is 23% for white renters and 27% for both
Black and Hispanic renters.

Impacts of the Bill
Exhibits 2 and 3 show the latest available count of unhoused individuals from 2024 for the United
States and for Maryland. This data is reported to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) after local jurisdictions around the nation conduct the annual Point-in-Time
(PIT) estimates. It should be noted that, according to DHCD, these surveys only offer a snapshot
of homelessness for both the sheltered and unsheltered on a single night, and that the number of
unhoused individuals counted in the PIT count is often approximately one-fifth of the total number
of unhoused clients served in a given year. In addition to the PIT count, DHCD collects data on
the annual number of clients served by providers in each year. These numbers include anyone that
was homeless or at risk of homelessness who received services such as prevention, outreach,
emergency shelters, rapid re-housing, and placement into permanent housing. In 2021, the total
number of clients served was 23,243.
To be included in the PIT count, a person must meet the definition of experiencing homelessness
used by HUD, which may differ from the definition used by other agencies. HUD defines
experiences of homelessness as lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. It
includes people staying in emergency shelters, safe havens, and transitional housing programs. It
also includes people who were experiencing unsheltered homelessness in places not meant for
human habitation such as on the streets, in abandoned buildings, bus stations, or in their cars.
HB 487/ Page 4

National Data
As shown in Exhibit 2, in the United States, Black, white, and Hispanic individuals are the bulk of
the homeless or unhoused population nationwide. In 2024, the national PIT count surveyed a total
of 771,480 individuals experiencing homelessness. Both exhibits below show the total portion of
unhoused individuals counted and the portion of individuals in that total who were observed in
sheltered conditions – such as temporary housing – versus those that were unsheltered or living
outside. The national data shows disparities by race and ethnicity as Black and Hispanic
individuals experienced homelessness at a much greater rate. While both of these groups combined
comprise over 60% of the total homeless individuals, they make up only 31% of the national
population. This is compared to white individuals who comprise 58% of the U.S. population but
make up just under 32% of the total homeless population. Asian, American Indian or Alaska
Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and Middle Eastern or North African individuals
made up less than 5% of the total.

Maryland Data
In Maryland, as shown in Exhibit 3, the PIT data confirms some of the persistent disparities found
in the national data for Black individuals. The State level PIT survey counted a total of 6,069
individuals experiencing homelessness around the State. Black unhoused individuals comprised
57% of that total compared to their 29% share of the State’s population and 28% of unhoused
individuals were white compared to their 47% share of the State’s population. Hispanic individuals
were 4% of the total unhoused population compared to their 12% portion of the State’s population.

Conclusion
The bill’s provisions aim to prevent the criminalization of homelessness and ensure the rights of
unhoused individuals under the law. This will benefit any individual experiencing homelessness
to the extent that the bill provides a means for civil action against violations of their rights by State
or local governments, an affirmative defense of necessity to protect against legal penalties for
performing basic survival tasks, and eliminates municipal vagrancy laws. The bill has the potential
to mitigate the persistent and cyclical adversity exacerbated by the criminalization of
homelessness, particularly for Black individuals that consistently face homelessness and its
contributing factors at disproportionately high rates at both the State and national levels.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
