6 and
7 (ii) Part of the State highway system.
8 (b) (1) Sidewalks shall be constructed at the time of construction or
9 reconstruction of an urban highway, or in response to the request of a local government
10 unless:
11 (i) The Administration determines that the cost or impacts of
12 constructing the sidewalks would be too great in relation to the need for them or their
13 probable use; or
14 (ii) The local government indicates that there is no need for
15 sidewalks.
16 (2) Sidewalks constructed under this section shall be consistent with area

18 (c) (1) If sidewalks or bicycle pathways are constructed or reconstructed as
19 part of a roadway construction or reconstruction project, the Administration shall fund the
20 sidewalk or bicycle pathway construction or reconstruction as a part of the cost of the
21 roadway project.
22 (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, if
23 sidewalks or bicycle pathways are constructed or reconstructed in response to a request
24 from a local government and the adjacent roadway is not being concurrently constructed or
25 reconstructed, the cost to construct or reconstruct the sidewalk or bicycle pathway shall be
26 shared equally between the State and local governments.
27 (3) If sidewalks or bicycle pathways within a sustainable community as
28 defined in § 6–301 of the Housing and Community Development Article are constructed or

7 2–112 OF THIS ARTICLE; OR
8 2. ANOTHER SIMILAR VISION ZERO PROGRAM UNDER
9 SUBTITLE 10 OF THIS TITLE.
10 (III) If sidewalks or bicycle pathways within an area designated as a
11 priority funding area under § 5–7B–02 of the State Finance and Procurement Article are
12 constructed or reconstructed in response to a request from a local government and the
13 adjacent roadway is not being concurrently constructed or reconstructed, and if the
14 Administration determines that construction would not occur under this section due to
15 insufficient contribution of funds by the local government, the cost to construct or
16 reconstruct the sidewalk or bicycle pathway shall be shared between the State and local
17 government as follows:
18 1. 75 percent of the cost shall be funded by the State; and
19 2. 25 percent of the cost shall be funded by the local
20 government.
21 [(iii)] (IV) If sidewalks or bicycle pathways within an area
22 designated as a priority funding area under § 5–7B–02 of the State Finance and
23 Procurement Article are constructed or reconstructed based on a determination by the
24 Administration that a substantial public safety risk or significant impediment to
25 pedestrian access exists and the adjacent roadway is not being concurrently constructed or
26 reconstructed, then:
27 1. The Administration shall categorize the sidewalk or
28 bicycle pathway construction project as “system preservation” and give corresponding
29 funding priority to the project; and
30 2. The cost to construct or reconstruct the sidewalk or bicycle
31 pathway may be funded entirely by the State.
32 (5) If sidewalks or bicycle pathways are being constructed or reconstructed
33 in response to a request from a local government and the adjacent roadway is not being
34 concurrently constructed or reconstructed, the local government shall:
35 (i) Provide public notice and opportunities for community
36 involvement prior to the construction of a sidewalk or bicycle pathway project; and

5 maintained and repaired by the political subdivision in which they are located.
6 (ii) Subject to approval and the availability of funds, the
7 Administration promptly shall reimburse a political subdivision for the preapproved and
8 documented costs incurred in reconstructing a segment of a sidewalk or bicycle pathway
9 that has deteriorated to the extent that repair is not practical or desirable for public safety.
10 (d) The Administration may not construct any project that will result in the
11 severance or destruction of an existing major route for pedestrian transportation traffic,
12 unless the project provides for construction of a reasonable alternative route or such a route
13 already exists.
14 (e) The Administration shall develop guidelines jointly with local governments to
15 carry out the provisions of this section.
16 (f) The Administration shall maintain and repair all facilities for nighttime
17 illumination that:
18 (1) Are constructed by the Administration for the safe conduct of vehicular
19 traffic; and
20 (2) Exist adjacent to urban highways.
