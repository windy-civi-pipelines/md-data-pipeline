Bill Summary
This bill generally reduces the penalties for offenses involving drug paraphernalia and controlled
paraphernalia.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s reduced penalties will shorten incarceration periods for those jailed for violating
prohibitions against the use, possession, delivery, or sale of certain drug paraphernalia and
obtaining or attempting to obtain controlled paraphernalia as specified under the bill. The
magnitude of the bill’s impacts on various demographic groups cannot be reliably estimated as no
detailed data is available on arrests, charges, or convictions for the bill’s specified drug
paraphernalia offenses. Available data on the number of charges and convictions from the
Administrative Office of the Courts, however, suggests that the provisions of the bill would apply
to a relatively small number of individuals. Accordingly, the magnitude of any equity impacts
would likely be minimal.
Analysis
The bill reduces penalties related to controlled drug paraphernalia from a maximum penalty of
four years imprisonment and/or a $25,000 maximum fine for all violations to (1) a $500 maximum
fine for a first violation and (2) imprisonment for up to one year and/or a $1,000 maximum fine
for a second or subsequent violation. Subsequent offender penalties for violation of the
prohibitions against the use or possession of drug paraphernalia and the delivery or sale of drug
paraphernalia are reduced from a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or $2,000 fine,
to a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment and/or $1,000 fine. The bill also clarifies the
distinction between the use of and the distribution of controlled drug paraphernalia.
SB 1009/ Page 1
Under existing law, without legal authorization, a person may not use or possess with intent to use
drug paraphernalia to (1) plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound,
convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, or conceal a
controlled dangerous substance (CDS); or (2) inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce a CDS
into the human body. Chapter 4 of 2016, however, repealed the criminal prohibition on use or
possession of marijuana-related drug paraphernalia.
In addition, a person may not deliver or sell, or manufacture or possess with the intent to deliver
or sell, drug paraphernalia, knowing or under circumstances where a person reasonably should
know that the drug paraphernalia will be used to (1) plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest,
manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store,
contain, or conceal a CDS; or (2) inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce a CDS into the
human body.
In general, a person may not obtain or attempt to obtain controlled paraphernalia by surreptitious
means, including fraud counterfeit prescriptions and other specified methods of deceit. “Controlled
paraphernalia” includes hypodermic needles and other items used to inject CDS, capsules and
other packaging for individual quantities of CDS, and specified substances used as a diluent or
adulterant.
Impacts of the Bill
According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, there was a combined total of 130 charges
in the District Court and 55 charges in the circuit court in fiscal 2023 for the offenses addressed
by the bill. Only one conviction (for use or possession of drug paraphernalia) was handed down
by each court during that time period. No demographic data was readily available for charges and
convictions; however, the relatively small number of charges and even smaller amount of
convictions suggest that the bill’s changes would likely have a minimal impact.
Conclusion
Generally, the bill’s reduced penalties will shorten incarceration periods for those jailed for
violating prohibitions against the use or possession of certain drug paraphernalia, delivery or sale
of drug paraphernalia, and obtaining or attempting to obtain controlled paraphernalia. The bill’s
impacts on various demographic groups cannot be reliably estimated as no detailed data is
available. Available data suggests that the number of individuals charged, arrested, and/or
convicted under these statutes are relatively small. Thus, the magnitude of any potential impacts
would likely be minimal.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
