SB0370
Bill Summary
This bill (1) reduces penalties for offenses involving drug paraphernalia and controlled
paraphernalia; (2) repeals specified prohibited acts under existing prohibitions involving drug
paraphernalia; (3) narrows the definition of “controlled paraphernalia” by removing references to
specified items; (4) repeals the prohibition on possessing or distributing controlled paraphernalia
to administer a controlled dangerous substance (CDS); and (5) removes measuring spoons from
the list of items commonly used to engage in specified CDS-related acts for purposes of
establishing an unlawful intent to use controlled paraphernalia to engage in those acts.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s modified definition of controlled drug paraphernalia will decrease the number of
individuals charged and convicted for CDS paraphernalia offenses related to the personal use of
CDS. The bill’s reduced penalties will also shorten incarceration periods for those jailed for
violating prohibitions against the use or possession of certain drug paraphernalia and delivery or
sale of drug paraphernalia. Limited data on arrests from the Department of State Police (DSP) for
the group of CDS paraphernalia offenses modified by the bill does not indicate racial or ethnic
disparities for people of color. The overall impacts of the bill on various demographic groups
cannot be reliably estimated as the available data does not distinguish between paraphernalia
offenses related to personal use and those related to the sale or distribution of CDS.
Analysis
The bill repeals the prohibition against CDS paraphernalia, adulterants, and dilutants that are used
to inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce a CDS into the human body. Accordingly, the bill
alters an element of the criminal prohibition against possession or distribution of controlled
SB 370/ Page 1
paraphernalia to include possession or distribut ion of controlled paraphernalia for purposes of
manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing (rather than administering) a CDS.
The bill also specifies that the prohibition on the use of or possession with the intent to use drug
paraphernalia and the delivery or sale, or manufacture or possession with the intent to deliver or
sell, drug paraphernalia, does not apply if the paraphernalia will be used to inject, ingest, inhale,
or otherwise introduce into the human body a CDS. Finally, the bill removes a measuring spoon
as an item commonly used to illegally manufacture, distribute, or dispense a CDS for purposes of
establishing an unlawful intent to use controlled paraphernalia to engage in these activities.
The bill also reduces penalties related to controlled paraphernalia from a maximum penalty of
four years imprisonment and/or a $25,000 fine to a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment
and/or a $1,000 fine. Subsequent offender penalties for violation of the prohibitions against the
use or possession of drug paraphernalia and the delivery or sale of drug paraphernalia are reduced
from a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or $2,000 fine to a maximum penalty of
one year imprisonment and/or $1,000 fine.
Drug Paraphernalia Arrests
The DSP crime reporting program is currently in the process of moving from its current reporting
system to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) National Incident Based Reporting System
(NIBRS). Effective January 1, 2021, the FBI mandated this change in crime reporting from the
existing Summary Reporting System to NIBRS. The move to NIBRS is designed to improve the
quality and quantity of crime data collected by law enforcement agencies. As of
November 15, 2024, most law enforcement agencies in Maryland have completed the transition to
NIBRS. This includes all primary agencies (county police/sheriff) in 22 counties and Baltimore
City. The 2023 data cited in this analysis is from NIBRS reporting agencies.
In general, NIBRS classifies drug/narcotic offenses as those that pertain to the illegal production,
distribution, and/or use of certain controlled substances and the equipment or devices utilized in
their preparation and/or use. Specifically, “drug equipment” or CDS paraphernalia violations refer
to the unlawful manufacture, sale, purchase, possession, or transportation of equipment or devices
utilized in preparing and/or using drugs or narcotics.
The available DSP arrest data for drug equipment/paraphernalia offenses suggest no disparities
exist that impact people of color in the State. During 2023, NIBRS reporting agencies reported
4,245 drug equipment violations resulting in 681 arrests. As shown in Exhibit 1, Black and white
arrestees comprised 30% and 62%, respectively, of the total arrestees. Hispanic arrestees
comprised 7% and Asian arrestees comprised 1% of the total. Other racial groups not shown in the
exhibit (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
individuals) accounted less than 1% of total arrestees. The data includes arrests for possession of
drug paraphernalia for both personal use and for the manufacture, sale, or distribution of CDS, and
does not distinguish between the two purposes.

Conclusion
Generally, the bill will decrease the number of individuals charged, convicted, and sentenced for
specified CDS paraphernalia offenses. The bill’s reduced penalties will also shorten incarceration
periods for those jailed for violating prohibitions against the use or possession of certain drug
paraphernalia and delivery or sale of drug paraphernalia.
The bill’s overall impact on various demographic groups cannot be reliably estimated as no
granular data is available on arrests and sentencing for drug paraphernalia offenses. The annual
Uniform Crime Report published by DSP releases composite data on various drug-related and
other offenses but does not isolate paraphernalia arrests by type of drug equipment or purpose.
Determining the actual racial equity impacts of the bill would require additional demographic data
regarding the offenses in the bill, grouped by intent or purpose, including data that captures by
racial and ethnic group the distribution of penalties related to use and possession of hypodermic
syringes, needles, or any other object or combination of objects adapted to administer a CDS by
hypodermic injection.

Appendix – Maryla nd Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest single race
demographic group in the State of Maryland comprising 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national population, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black
or African American, with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black or African
American and another 2.5% identifying as Black in combination with some other race. Maryland’s
Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher than the Asian share of the national population of
6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity, however, is slightly less diverse than the
U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19%
of the U.S. population.

SB0370
Drug Paraphernalia for Administration - Decriminalization
Bill Summary
This bill (1) reduces penalties for offenses involving drug paraphernalia and controlled
paraphernalia; (2) repeals specified prohibited acts under existing prohibitions involving drug
paraphernalia; (3) narrows the definition of “controlled paraphernalia” by removing references to
specified items; (4) repeals the prohibition on possessing or distributing controlled paraphernalia
to administer a controlled dangerous substance (CDS); and (5) removes measuring spoons from
the list of items commonly used to engage in specified CDS-related acts for purposes of
establishing an unlawful intent to use controlled paraphernalia to engage in those acts.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s modified definition of controlled drug paraphernalia will decrease the number of
individuals charged and convicted for CDS paraphernalia offenses related to the personal use of
CDS. The bill’s reduced penalties will also shorten incarceration periods for those jailed for
violating prohibitions against the use or possession of certain drug paraphernalia and delivery or
sale of drug paraphernalia. Limited data on arrests from the Department of State Police (DSP) for
the group of CDS paraphernalia offenses modified by the bill does not indicate racial or ethnic
disparities for people of color. The overall impacts of the bill on various demographic groups
cannot be reliably estimated as the available data does not distinguish between paraphernalia
offenses related to personal use and those related to the sale or distribution of CDS.
Analysis
The bill repeals the prohibition against CDS paraphernalia, adulterants, and dilutants that are used
to inject, ingest, inhale, or otherwise introduce a CDS into the human body. Accordingly, the bill
alters an element of the criminal prohibition against possession or distribution of controlled
SB 370/ Page 1

paraphernalia to include possession or distribut ion of controlled paraphernalia for purposes of
manufacturing, distributing, or dispensing (rather than administering) a CDS.
The bill also specifies that the prohibition on the use of or possession with the intent to use drug
paraphernalia and the delivery or sale, or manufacture or possession with the intent to deliver or
sell, drug paraphernalia, does not apply if the paraphernalia will be used to inject, ingest, inhale,
or otherwise introduce into the human body a CDS. Finally, the bill removes a measuring spoon
as an item commonly used to illegally manufacture, distribute, or dispense a CDS for purposes of
establishing an unlawful intent to use controlled paraphernalia to engage in these activities.
The bill also reduces penalties related to controlled paraphernalia from a maximum penalty of
four years imprisonment and/or a $25,000 fine to a maximum penalty of one year imprisonment
and/or a $1,000 fine. Subsequent offender penalties for violation of the prohibitions against the
use or possession of drug paraphernalia and the delivery or sale of drug paraphernalia are reduced
from a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or $2,000 fine to a maximum penalty of
one year imprisonment and/or $1,000 fine.
Drug Paraphernalia Arrests
The DSP crime reporting program is currently in the process of moving from its current reporting
system to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) National Incident Based Reporting System
(NIBRS). Effective January 1, 2021, the FBI mandated this change in crime reporting from the
existing Summary Reporting System to NIBRS. The move to NIBRS is designed to improve the
quality and quantity of crime data collected by law enforcement agencies. As of
November 15, 2024, most law enforcement agencies in Maryland have completed the transition to
NIBRS. This includes all primary agencies (county police/sheriff) in 22 counties and Baltimore
City. The 2023 data cited in this analysis is from NIBRS reporting agencies.
In general, NIBRS classifies drug/narcotic offenses as those that pertain to the illegal production,
distribution, and/or use of certain controlled substances and the equipment or devices utilized in
their preparation and/or use. Specifically, “drug equipment” or CDS paraphernalia violations refer
to the unlawful manufacture, sale, purchase, possession, or transportation of equipment or devices
utilized in preparing and/or using drugs or narcotics.
The available DSP arrest data for drug equipment/paraphernalia offenses suggest no disparities
exist that impact people of color in the State. During 2023, NIBRS reporting agencies reported
4,245 drug equipment violations resulting in 681 arrests. As shown in Exhibit 1, Black and white
arrestees comprised 30% and 62%, respectively, of the total arrestees. Hispanic arrestees
comprised 7% and Asian arrestees comprised 1% of the total. Other racial groups not shown in the
exhibit (i.e., American Indian or Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
individuals) accounted less than 1% of total arrestees. The data includes arrests for possession of
drug paraphernalia for both personal use and for the manufacture, sale, or distribution of CDS, and
does not distinguish between the two purposes.

Appendix – Maryla nd Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest single race
demographic group in the State of Maryland comprising 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national population, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black
or African American, with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black or African
American and another 2.5% identifying as Black in combination with some other race. Maryland’s
Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher than the Asian share of the national population of
6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity, however, is slightly less diverse than the
U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19%
of the U.S. population.
