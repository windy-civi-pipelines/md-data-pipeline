13 been designated by the Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when requested
14 by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be heard with
15 respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer inquiries relative
16 thereto.
17 (8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
18 appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
19 the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other
20 appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the provisions following: (a) Every
21 such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
22 or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
23 Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
24 appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
25 be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless
26 it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
27 elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
28 Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
29 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
30 apply.
31 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General Assembly
32 from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of Article 3 of the
33 Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in Section 17 of
34 Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment of any
35 obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the Constitution of
36 the United States.
37 (10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the Legislature
38 seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue a
39 proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
40 judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
41 be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
42 (11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require from the

SENATE BILL 288 15
1 proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and administrative
2 offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise the
3 expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
4 itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
5 the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
6 effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
7 the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
8 in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
9 of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
10 Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
11 transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
12 and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
13 (12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
14 require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all
15 institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
16 the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary
17 departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
18 may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
19 which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
20 before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
21 (13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
22 inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
23 (14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this Section
24 and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section shall
25 prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of Article
26 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance thereof, or
27 be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of the General
28 Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General Assembly at
29 such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
30 appropriations.
31 (15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this
32 Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
33 of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.
34 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Assembly
35 determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
36 Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland
37 Constitution concerning local approval of constitutional amendments do not apply.
38 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:
39 (a) The amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
40 Act shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State at the next general election to be

16 SENATE BILL 288
1 held in November 2026 for adoption or rejection pursuant to Article XIV of the Maryland
2 Constitution.
3 (b) (1) At that general election, the vote on the proposed amendment to the
4 Constitution shall be by ballot, and on each ballot there shall be printed the words “For the
5 Constitutional Amendment” and “Against the Constitutional Amendment”, as now
6 provided by law.
7 (2) At that general election, a question substantially similar to the
8 following shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State:
9 “Question ___ – Constitutional Amendment
10 Providing that each budget shall include expenditures necessary to implement wages,
11 hours, fringe benefits, health benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for
12 State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding covering State
13 employees.”.
14 (c) Immediately after the election, all returns shall be made to the Governor of
15 the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
16 Maryland Constitution, and further proceedings had in accordance with Article XIV.
17 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That, except as provided in Section
