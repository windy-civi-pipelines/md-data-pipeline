Preamble
WHEREAS, As a result of an open, transparent, and comprehensive planning
process, NextEra Energy Transmission MidAtlantic, Inc., through certain affiliates, has
been designated by PJM Interconnection, LLC, the regional electric transmission
organization for Maryland, to construct an overhead transmission line to address and
resolve certain reliability issues impacting the electric transmission system serving the
State’s and surrounding region’s electric customers; and
WHEREAS, Before beginning construction of an overhead transmission line,
NextEra Energy Transmission MidAtlantic, Inc., must first obtain a certificate of public
convenience and necessity, in accordance with the requirements in § 7–207 of the Public
Utilities Article, to demonstrate that the transmission line is consistent with the public

interest and public need and subject the proposed transmission line to a comprehensive
review and input process involving the public, relevant local governments, and each
appropriate State unit; and
WHEREAS, Before approving an application for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity, the Public Service Commission must provide an opportunity for public
comment and hold a public hearing on the application in each county and municipal
corporation in which any portion of the construction of an overhead transmission line is
proposed to be located; and
WHEREAS, The Public Service Commission may take final action on an application
for a certificate of public convenience and necessity only after due consideration of, among
other things:
(1) the recommendation of the governing body of each county or municipal
corporation in which any portion of the construction of the overhead transmission line is
proposed to be located; and
(2) the effect of the overhead transmission line on:
(i) the stability and reliability of the electric system;
(ii) economics;
(iii) aesthetics;
(iv) historic sites;
(v) aviation safety as determined by the Maryland Aviation
Administration and the administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration; and

and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of State wildlands.

the people of Maryland in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for the future use and
enjoyment as wildlands, to provide for their protection, preservation of their wildland
character, and for gathering and dissemination of information regarding their use and
enjoyment as wildlands.
(4) A State land may not be designated as a wildland area except as
provided for in this section or by a subsequent act.
