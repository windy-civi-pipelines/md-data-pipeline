8 (e) “Forensic genetic genealogical DNA analysis and search” or “FGGS” means:
9 (1) the forensic genetic genealogical DNA analysis of biological material
10 using SNP or other sequencing techniques to develop an FGG profile;
11 (2) a subsequent search using the FGG profile in a publicly available
12 open–data personal genomics database or a direct–to–consumer genetic genealogy service
13 to find individuals related to the source of the FGG profile; and
14 (3) a genealogical search using public records and other lawful means to
15 obtain information in accordance with this title.
16 17–102.
17 (a) (1) FGGS may not be initiated without judicial authorization and without

9 to public safety or national security concerns, reasonable investigative leads have been
