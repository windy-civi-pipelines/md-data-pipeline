1 WHEREAS, Title 20, Subtitle 7 of the Local Government Article provides for the
2 specific uses of revenues received from development impact fees; and
3 WHEREAS, County Commissioners of code counties may impose development
4 impact fees by public local law to finance any of the capital costs of additional or expanded
5 public works improvements, and facilities required to accommodate new construction or
6 development; and
7 WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of the United States, in Sheetz v. County of El
8 Dorado, 601 U.S. ____ (2024), held that local government permit conditions (1) must have
9 an “essential nexus” to the government’s land use interests, and “rough proportionality” to
10 the development’s impact on the land use interest; and (2) may not require a landowner to
11 give up or pay more than is necessary to mitigate harms caused from new development;
12 now, therefore,
