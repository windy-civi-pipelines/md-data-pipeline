Annotated Code of Maryland
(2013 Volume and 2024 Supplement)
Preamble
WHEREAS, Local governments in Maryland must have authority from the
Maryland General Assembly in order to impose a development impact fee or an excise tax;
and
WHEREAS, Code home rule counties are authorized collectively to impose specified
development impact fees and excise taxes, and many counties have specific authorizations
from the Maryland General Assembly; and
WHEREAS, Title 20, Subtitle 7 of the Local Government Article provides for the
specific uses of revenues received from development impact fees; and
WHEREAS, County Commissioners of code counties may impose development
impact fees by public local law to finance any of the capital costs of additional or expanded
public works improvements, and facilities required to accommodate new construction or
development; and
WHEREAS, The Supreme Court of the United States, in Sheetz v. County of El
Dorado, 601 U.S. ____ (2024), held that local government permit conditions (1) must have
an “essential nexus” to the government’s land use interests, and “rough proportionality” to
the development’s impact on the land use interest; and (2) may not require a landowner to
give up or pay more than is necessary to mitigate harms caused from new development;
now, therefore,
