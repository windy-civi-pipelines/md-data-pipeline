SENATE BILL 623 3
1 The bonds may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the County, at
2 such price or prices and under such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the County
3 prior to the issuance of the bonds, either in the resolution or in a bond order pursuant to
4 the bond resolution. The bonds may be issued in registered form and provision may be made
5 for the registration of the principal only. In case any officer whose signature appears on
6 any bond ceases to be such officer before the delivery thereof, such signature shall
7 nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he had remained in office until
8 such delivery. The bonds and the issuance and sale thereof shall be exempt from the
9 provisions of §§ 19–205 and 19–206 of the Local Government Article of the Annotated Code
10 of Maryland, as amended.
11 The County may enter into agreements with agents, banks, fiduciaries, insurers, or
12 others for the purpose of enhancing the marketability of any security for the bonds and for
13 the purpose of securing any tender option that may be granted to holders of the bonds, all
14 as may be determined and presented in the aforesaid resolution, which may (but need not)
15 state as security for the performance by the County of any monetary obligations under such
16 agreements the same security given by the County to bondholders for the performance by
17 the County of its monetary obligations under the bonds.
18 If the County determines in the resolution to offer any of the bonds by solicitation of
19 competitive bids at public sale, the resolution shall fix the terms and conditions of the public
20 sale and shall adopt a form of notice of sale, which shall outline the terms and conditions,
21 and a form of advertisement, which shall be published in one or more daily or weekly
22 newspapers having a general circulation in the County and which may also be published in
23 one or more journals having a circulation primarily among banks and investment bankers.
24 At least one publication of the advertisement shall be made not less than 10 days before
25 the sale of the bonds.
26 Upon delivery of any bonds to the purchaser or purchasers, payment therefor shall
27 be made to the Treasurer of St. Mary’s County or such other official of St. Mary’s County
28 as may be designated to receive such payment in a resolution passed by the County before
29 such delivery.
30 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the net proceeds of the sale
31 of bonds shall be used and applied exclusively and solely for the acquisition, construction,
32 improvement, or development of public facilities for which the bonds are sold. If the
33 amounts borrowed shall prove inadequate to finance the projects described in the
34 resolution, the County may issue additional bonds with the limitations hereof for the
35 purpose of evidencing the borrowing of additional funds for such financing, provided the
36 resolution authorizing the sale of additional bonds shall so recite, but if the net proceeds of
37 the sale of any issue of bonds exceed the amount needed to finance the projects described
38 in the resolution, the excess funds so borrowed and not expended shall be applied to the
39 payment of the next principal maturity of the bonds or to the redemption of any part of the
40 bonds which have been made redeemable or to the purchase and cancellation of bonds,
41 unless the County shall adopt a resolution allocating the excess funds to the acquisition,
42 construction, improvement, or development of other public facilities, as defined and within
43 the limits set forth in this Act.

4 SENATE BILL 623
1 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the bonds hereby authorized
2 shall constitute, and they shall so recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit
3 and unlimited taxing power of the County to the payment of the maturing principal of and
4 interest on the bonds as and when they become payable. In each and every fiscal year that
5 any of the bonds are outstanding, the County shall levy or cause to be levied ad valorem
6 taxes upon all the assessable property within the corporate limits of the County in rate and
7 amount sufficient to provide for or assure the payment, when due, of the principal of and
8 interest on all the bonds maturing in each such fiscal year and, in the event the proceeds
9 from the taxes so levied in any such fiscal year shall prove inadequate for such payment,
10 additional taxes shall be levied in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any such deficiency.
11 The County may apply to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued
12 hereunder any funds received by it from the State of Maryland, the United States of
13 America, any agency or instrumentality thereof, or from any other source, if such funds are
14 granted for the purpose of assisting the County in financing the acquisition, construction,
15 improvement, or development of the public facilities defined in this Act and, to the extent
16 of any such funds received or receivable in any fiscal year, the taxes that are required to be
17 levied under this Act may be reduced accordingly.
18 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County is further
19 authorized and empowered, at any time and from time to time, to issue its bonds in the
20 manner hereinabove described for the purpose of refunding, by payment at maturity or
21 upon purchase or redemption, any bonds issued hereunder. The validity of any such
22 refunding bonds shall in no way be dependent upon or related to the validity or invalidity
23 of the obligations so refunded. The powers herein granted with respect to the issuance of
24 bonds shall be applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be
25 issued by the County in such an amount as shall be necessary for the purpose of providing
26 it with funds to pay any of its outstanding bonds issued hereunder at maturity, for the
27 purpose of providing it with funds to purchase in the open market any of its outstanding
28 bonds issued hereunder, prior to the maturity thereof, or for the purpose of providing it
29 with funds for the redemption prior to maturity of any outstanding bonds issued hereunder
30 which are, by their terms, redeemable, for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay
31 interest on any outstanding bonds issued hereunder prior to their payment at maturity of
32 purchase or redemption in advance of maturity, or for the purpose of providing it with funds
33 to pay any redemption or purchase premium in connection with the refunding of any of its
34 outstanding bonds issued hereunder. The proceeds of the sale of any such refunding bonds
35 shall be segregated and set apart by the County as a separate trust fund to be used solely
36 for the purpose of paying the purchase or redemption prices of the bonds to be refunded.
37 SECTION 7. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County may, prior to the
38 preparation of definitive bonds, issue interim certificates or temporary bonds, exchangeable
39 for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for such
40 delivery, provided, however, that any such interim certificates or temporary bonds shall be
41 issued in all respects subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Act. The
42 County may, by appropriate resolution, provide for the replacement of any bonds issued
43 hereunder which shall have become mutilated or lost or destroyed upon such conditions
44 and after receiving such indemnity as the County may require.

SENATE BILL 623 5
1 SECTION 8. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any and all obligations issued
2 pursuant to the authority of this Act, their transfer, the interest payable thereon, and any
3 income derived therefrom in the hands of the holders thereof from time to time (including
4 any profit made in the sale thereof) shall be and are hereby declared to be at all times
5 exempt from State, county, municipal, or other taxation of every kind and nature
6 whatsoever within the State of Maryland. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the County
7 from authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable
8 from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
9 SECTION 9. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the authority to borrow
10 money and issue bonds conferred on the County by this Act shall be deemed to provide an
11 additional and alternative authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as
12 supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the County by other laws and shall
13 not be regarded as in derogation of any power now existing; and all Acts of the General
14 Assembly of Maryland heretofore passed authorizing the County to borrow money are
15 hereby continued to the extent that the powers contained in such Acts have not been
16 exercised, and nothing contained in this Act may be construed to impair, in any way, the
17 validity of any bonds that may have been issued by the County under the authority of any
18 said Acts, and the validity of the bonds is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. This
19 Act, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of St. Mary’s County, shall be
20 liberally construed to effect the purposes hereof. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent
21 with the provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
22 SECTION 10. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
23 June 1, 2025.
