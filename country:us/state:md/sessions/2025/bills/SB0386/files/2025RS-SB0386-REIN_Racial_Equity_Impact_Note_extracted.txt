Section 1:
2025 Session
SB0386
Reportable Offense - Alterations
Bill Summary
This bill expands the definition of “reportable offense” to include an offense that occurs on the
premises of a public school or at an event sponsored by a public school. It also requires the
Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) to promptly notify the local superintendent and the school
principal of a decision made during an inquiry by an intake officer into the jurisdiction of a circuit
court acting as the juvenile court, in specified circumstances.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
It is unclear whether the bill’s expanded definition of reportable offenses that includes on-campus
and off-campus school sponsored events will materially affect the number of arrests reported to
school officials since school officials are likely involved in the initiation of arrests that occur on
school grounds or at school sponsored events. Due to reforms enacted in 2022, school officials
must follow existing disciplinary rules for both on-campus and off-campus arrests, thus any
increase in reporting of these offenses is unlikely to result in disproportionate disciplinary actions.
The bill’s requirement for DJS to report on the dispositions of reportable offense arrests that result
in no action or that are adjusted informally could positively impact affected students that have been
removed from in-person learning or otherwise disciplined by ensuring their prompt return to
regular school programming.
Analysis
The bill would require law enforcement to report arrests of students for specified reportable
offenses regardless of where they occurred and require DJS to promptly notify the local
SB 386/ Page 1
superintendent and school principal of any juve nile intake decision that results in an informal
adjustment or no formal complaint for a reportable offense.
Under existing law, a reportable offense is an offense that (1) occurred off school premises; (2) did
not occur at an event sponsored by the school; and (3) includes a crime of violence, as specified in
current law, and numerous other specified weapons, drug, assault, and theft related offenses. When
a student is arrested for a reportable offense or an offense related to the student’s membership in a
criminal organization, the law enforcement agency making the arrest must notify (1) the local
superintendent; (2) the school principal; and (3) if appropriate, the school security officer. The law
enforcement agency may also notify the State’s Attorney.
In 2022, the General Assembly expressed concern about the purported misuse or overuse of school
removals for students arrested for a reportable offense. Chapter 742 of 2022 clarifies that a
“reportable offense” as it relates to students in public or nonpublic schools is an offense that
occurred off school premises and did not occur at an event sponsored by the school. The Act also
requires that students accused of reportable offenses be disciplined according to existing State
regulations and provides for additional due process accommodations by allowing a student accused
of a reportable offense to have an attorney attend the conference between the student or parent and
principal or county superintendent.
Juvenile Intake Process
The intake process for juveniles accused of any criminal offense requires a determination as to
whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction and whether judicial action is in the best interest of the
public and/or the child. DJS intake officers are authorized to (1) disapprove a complaint as legally
insufficient; (2) resolve the matter at intake with or without services; (3) propose an informal
adjustment period (also called pre-court supervision); or (4) authorize the filing of a petition by
the State’s Attorney’s Office. While DJS can informally handle all complaints, violent felonies
and handgun violations must be reviewed by the State’s Attorney and approved for informal
adjustment/pre-court supervision. Informal adjustments serve to divert youth from formal juvenile
court processing.
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) reported 986 reportable offense incidents
during the 2022-2023 school year. Of these incidents, 65% involved Black students, 18% were
white, 9% were Hispanic, and 6% involved students of two or more races. Asian, American Indian
or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders account for less than 2% of the total.

group’s share of the State’s public school population during the same time period.

MSDE also tracks arrests that occurred as a result of a referral of a student by school personnel to
law enforcement or to DJS for a disciplinary offense that occurred on school grounds or during
off-campus activities, including transportation to and from school. Exhibit 2 shows the racial and
ethnic breakdown of on-campus school arrests during the 2022-2023 school year compared to
enrollment data. Offense categories include sex offenses, weapons violations, threats, serious
bodily injury, fighting, and alcohol and drug violations. The data shows 57% of arrestees were
Black students, 25% were white, 9% were Hispanic, and 8% were students of two or more races.
Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders account for
less than 2% of the total.

Conclusion
Data from MSDE confirms significant disparities among racial groups arrested for reportable
offenses as defined under existing law. It is unclear whether the bill’s expansion of the definition
of reportable offenses would result in any increased disciplinary actions for affected students
because schools must follow the same disciplinary procedures as it does with other students –
something that may not have been the case before 2022. It is also unclear whether the expanded
definition would capture formerly unreported arrests that school officials are unaware of under the
existing process for reporting and handling arrests of students both on and off campus. The bill’s
notification requirement for DJS to notify school officials of certain post-arrest outcomes for
reportable offense arrests would benefit the affected students by allowing a faster return to regular
school programming in those cases where an arrested student is not referred to formal proceedings.
Black students, in particular, may be impacted to the greatest extent as they make up a substantially
large portion of reportable offense arrests as well as arrests on campus. The specific impacts,
however, cannot be determined without more longitudinal data on arrest outcomes.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
