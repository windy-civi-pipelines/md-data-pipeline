Section 1:
2025 Session
HB0734
Real Time for Violent Crime Act
This bill prohibits (1) the earning of diminution credits to reduce the term of confinement of an
incarcerated individual who is serving a sentence for first- or second-degree murder in a State or
local correctional facility (pre-sentence or post-sentence) and (2) the application of diminution
credits that equal more than 10% of an incarcerated individual’s aggregate sentence for crimes of
violence. The bill also prohibits a judicial officer from authorizing the pretrial release of a
defendant who is charged with a crime of violence if the defendant (1) has a pending charge for a
crime of violence in Maryland (or a crime in another jurisdiction that would be a crime of violence
if committed in Maryland) or (2) within the previous 10 years, was convicted in Maryland of a
crime of violence (or in any other jurisdiction of a crime that would be a crime of violence if
committed in Maryland). The bill’s provisions apply prospectively only.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill would add first- and second-degree murder into the existing set of criminal convictions
for which the accumulation of diminution credits for purposes of sentence reduction is prohibited.
Additionally, it would prohibit the deduction of diminution credits of more than 10% of an
incarcerated individual’s aggregate sentence for a crime of violence. While prospective in nature,
the bill’s provisions directly impact the largely Black incarcerated population in Maryland by
prohibiting or limiting the use of diminution credits to reduce their terms of incarceration.
According to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), Black inmates
currently makeup 78% of those incarcerated for first- or second-degree murder, and the availability
of diminution credits is a key rehabilitative component for inmates. The larger equity impacts
regarding recidivism, reentry success, and potential adverse effects for juveniles and young adults
cannot be estimated without additional data.

Current Law

Section 2:
Section 14-101(a) of the Criminal Law Article defines a “crime of violence” as (1) abduction;
(2) arson in the first degree; (3) kidnapping; (4) manslaughter, except involuntary manslaughter;
(5) mayhem; (6) maiming; (7) murder; (8) rape; (9) robbery; (10) carjacking (including armed
carjacking); (11) first- and second-degree sexual offenses; (12) use of a firearm in the commission
of a felony or other crime of violence, except possession with intent to distribute a controlled
dangerous substance; (13) child abuse in the first degree; (14) sexual abuse of a minor under
specified circumstances; (15) home invasion; (16) felony sex trafficking and forced marriage;
(17) an attempt to commit crimes (1) through (16); (18) continuing course of certain sexual
conduct with a child; (19) assault in the first degree; and (20) assault with intent to murder, rape,
rob, or commit a sexual offense in the first or second degree.
Individuals convicted of first-degree murder in Maryland must be sentenced to life in prison or life
in prison without parole. Pursuant to Chapter 30 of the 2021 special session, an inmate sentenced
to life imprisonment for a crime committed on or after October 1, 2021, is not eligible for parole
until the inmate has served 20 years, or the equivalent of 20 years with allowances for diminution
credits (prior to Chapter 30, a 15-year time period applied to this eligibility). Inmates convicted of
first-degree murder must serve 25 years minus diminution credits when life without parole was
sought but not imposed by the court. Those convicted of the specified crimes of violence may not
face a sentence less than the minimum sentence of 5 years as outlined by § 4-306 of the Criminal
Law Article.
Under the bill, individuals sentenced to life imprisonment for first-degree murder would serve a
full 20 years (or 25 years when applicable) without the ability to earn diminution credits to shorten
that time. Similarly, those convicted of second-degree murder may be sentenced for up to a
maximum of 40 years and the length of time required before parole eligibility could not be
shortened with diminution credits. The bill also restricts a judicial officer from authorizing the
pretrial release of any defendant charged with a crime of violence who has specified pending
charges or prior convictions.
Diminution Credits Generally
Generally, a convicted individual sentenced to a term of incarceration in the Division of Correction
is, with specific exceptions, able to earn diminution credits to reduce the term of incarceration.
Inmates in both State correctional facilities and local detention centers are eligible for diminution
credits. Additionally, convicted individuals may earn diminution credits for any period of
pre-sentence or post-sentence confinement in a local correctional facility.
Good conduct credit (sometimes referred to as “good time” credit) is advanced to an inmate at
intake, subject to the inmate’s future good behavior. These credits are calculated from the first day
of commitment to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction through the maximum expiration
date of the inmate’s term of confinement. Maryland courts recognize good conduct credits as a
behavioral incentive and a means of reducing prison overcrowding. The awarding of diminution
credits is automatic, not discretionary.
HB 734/ Page 2
For sentences imposed on or after October 1, 2017 , Chapter 515 of 2016 altered provisions relating
to sentencing, corrections, parole, and the supervision of offenders. With regard to diminution
credits, Chapter 515 increased the maximum total deduction from 20 to 30 days per calendar month
for all State correctional facility inmates except for inmates serving a sentence for a crime of
violence, specified sexual offenders, or being a volume drug dealer or drug kingpin. Chapter 515
also increased the maximum deduction for special selected work projects or other special programs
from 10 to 20 days per calendar month and expanded the types of programs for which an inmate
may earn diminution credits. Individuals sentenced for a crime of violence earn diminution credits
at a lower rate than other inmates.
Chapter 712 of 2024 prohibits an incarcerated individual who is serving a sentence in a State or
local correctional facility for first-degree rape that occurred on or after October 1, 2024, from
earning diminution credits to reduce the incarcerated individual’s term of confinement.
Impacts of the Bill
DPSCS reports that as of January 2025, Black individuals comprise 72% of the total incarcerated
population compared to their 29% share of the State’s population. More specifically, Exhibit 1
shows the racial and ethnic demographic breakdown of inmates whose most serious offense was
first- or second degree-murder. Out of a total of 3,556 inmates, Black inmates account for 78%
and white inmates make up 16%.

HB 734/ Page 3
The bill would substantially increase sentence le ngths for those incarcerated for murder. By way
of example, a person convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment under
existing law must serve 20 years before being eligible for parole or just under 17 years if the person
earns 100% of good conduct credits (5 days per month). Parole eligibility can also be further
accelerated with additional credits (i.e., education and special project credits) of up to 20 days per
month. The extension of incarceration lengths resulting from the bill would work similarly for
those convicted of second-degree murder. According to DPSCS data, the average number of
diminution credits earned in years for this subset of the incarcerated population is almost 8 years
for both Black and white inmates and just under 7 years for Hispanic inmates.
DPSCS advises that it uses an inmate’s ability to earn diminution credits as an incentive to
encourage good behavior and participate in rehabilitative and/or work programs. By eliminating
the applicability of diminution credits for inmates serving a life sentence for murder, DPSCS
advises that it loses a key tool for modifying inmate behavior. In addition, DPSCS indicates that
the elimination of diminution credits could decrease the number of inmates who are working or
participating in prison programming and also could potentially increase institutional violence. Data
was not available to access specific impacts for individuals incarcerated for crimes of violence.
Conclusion
According to DPSCS, prohibiting the use of diminution credits to reduce terms of incarceration
would eliminate a key rehabilitative component for inmates. The bill’s impact can be measured in
years for incarcerated individuals and could potentially work to discourage positive behaviors
among inmates currently incarcerated for murder.
The largely Black incarcerated population in Maryland will be impacted by the bill to the greatest
extent going forward assuming demographic trends continue beyond the bill’s effective date.
Determining the larger equity impacts requires additional information, such as whether increased
incarceration time would affect recidivism and reentry success among affected individuals. In
addition, there may be significant impacts regarding juveniles or young adults incarcerated for
murder. However, there is no reliable data currently available to assess these potential impacts.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
