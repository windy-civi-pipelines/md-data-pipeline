8 (3) THE COMMISSION SHALL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE SERVICE OF

31 ONLY AFTER ALL OTHER MEANS OF SECURING COMPLIANCE HAVE BEEN
32 EXHAUSTED. NOTICE OF INTENT TO SUSPEND OR TERMINATE SHALL BE GIVEN BY

7 FOR A MINIMUM OF SIX MONTHS AFTER THE DATE OF SAID NOTICE OF TERMINATION.
8 (G) THE COMMISSION MAY NOT BEAR ANY COSTS RELATED TO A STATE
9 THAT IS FOUND TO BE IN DEFAULT OR THAT HAS BEEN TERMINATED FROM THE
10 COMPACT, UNLESS AGREED UPON IN WRITING BETWEEN THE COMMISSION AND THE
11 DEFAULTING STATE.
12 (H) THE DEFAULTING STATE MAY APPEAL THE ACTION OF THE COMMISSION
13 BY PETITIONING THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OR
14 THE FEDERAL DISTRICT WHERE THE COMMISSION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES.

16 INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES.
17 (I) (1) UPON REQUEST BY A MEMBER STATE, THE COMMISSION SHALL
18 ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE DISPUTES RELATED TO THE COMPACT THAT ARISE AMONG
19 MEMBER STATES AND BETWEEN MEMBER AND NON–MEMBER STATES.
20 (2) THE COMMISSION SHALL PROMULGATE A RULE PROVIDING FOR
21 BOTH MEDIATION AND BINDING DISPUTE RESOLUTION FOR DISPUTES AS
22 APPROPRIATE.
23 (J) (1) BY MAJORITY VOTE AS PROVIDED BY RULE, THE COMMISSION
24 MAY INITIATE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST A MEMBER STATE IN DEFAULT IN THE
25 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OR THE
26 FEDERAL DISTRICT WHERE THE COMMISSION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES TO
27 ENFORCE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE COMPACT AND ITS
28 PROMULGATED RULES. THE RELIEF SOUGHT MAY INCLUDE BOTH INJUNCTIVE
29 RELIEF AND DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT IS NECESSARY, THE
30 PREVAILING MEMBER SHALL BE AWARDED ALL COSTS OF SUCH LITIGATION,
31 INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES. THE REMEDIES HEREIN SHALL NOT BE
32 THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION MAY PURSUE
33 ANY OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE UNDER FEDERAL OR THE DEFAULTING MEMBER
34 STATE’S LAW.
35 (2) A MEMBER STATE MAY INITIATE LEGAL ACTION AGAINST THE
36 COMMISSION IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OR
37 THE FEDERAL DISTRICT WHERE THE COMMISSION HAS ITS PRINCIPAL OFFICES TO

HOUSE BILL 345 31

2 PROMULGATED RULES. THE RELIEF SOUGHT MAY INCLUDE BOTH INJUNCTIVE
3 RELIEF AND DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT IS NECESSARY, THE
4 PREVAILING PARTY SHALL BE AWARDED ALL COSTS OF SUCH LITIGATION,
5 INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES.

7 COMPACT AGAINST THE COMMISSION.
8 SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT.
9 (A) THE COMPACT SHALL COME INTO EFFECT ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE

11 (1) ON OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE COMPACT, THE
12 COMMISSION SHALL CONVENE AND REVIEW THE ENACTMENT OF EACH OF THE
13 FIRST SEVEN MEMBER STATES (“CHARTER MEMBER STATES”) TO DETERMINE IF
14 THE STATUTE ENACTED BY EACH SUCH CHARTER MEMBER STATE IS MATERIALLY
15 DIFFERENT THAN THE MODEL COMPACT STATUTE.
16 (I) A CHARTER MEMBER STATE WHOSE ENACTMENT IS FOUND
17 TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODEL COMPACT STATUTE SHALL BE
18 ENTITLED TO THE DEFAULT PROCESS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.
19 (II) IF ANY MEMBER STATE IS LATER FOUND TO BE IN DEFAULT,
20 OR IS TERMINATED OR WITHDRAWS FROM THE COMPACT, THE COMMISSION SHALL
21 REMAIN IN EXISTENCE AND THE COMPACT SHALL REMAIN IN EFFECT EVEN IF THE
22 NUMBER OF MEMBER STATES SHOULD BE LESS THAN SEVEN.
23 (2) MEMBER STATES ENACTING THE COMPACT SUBSEQUENT TO THE
24 SEVEN INITIAL CHARTER MEMBER STATES SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROCESS SET
25 FORTH IN SECTION 10(C)(21) TO DETERMINE IF THEIR ENACTMENTS ARE
26 MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE MODEL COMPACT STATUTE AND WHETHER
27 THEY QUALIFY FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPACT.
28 (3) ALL ACTIONS TAKEN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMISSION OR
29 IN FURTHERANCE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMPACT
30 PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE COMPACT OR THE COMMISSION COMING
31 INTO EXISTENCE SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO BE ACTIONS OF THE COMMISSION
32 UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REPUDIATED BY THE COMMISSION.
33 (4) ANY STATE THAT JOINS THE COMPACT SUBSEQUENT TO THE
34 COMMISSION’S INITIAL ADOPTION OF THE RULES AND BYLAWS SHALL BE SUBJECT
35 TO THE RULES AND BYLAWS AS THEY EXIST ON THE DATE ON WHICH THE COMPACT

32 HOUSE BILL 345
1 BECOMES LAW IN THAT STATE. ANY RULE THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED BY
2 THE COMMISSION SHALL HAVE THE FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OF LAW ON THE DAY
3 THE COMPACT BECOMES LAW IN THAT STATE.
4 (B) ANY MEMBER STATE MAY WITHDRAW FROM THE COMPACT BY
5 ENACTING A STATUTE REPEALING THE SAME.
6 (1) A MEMBER STATE’S WITHDRAWAL SHALL NOT TAKE EFFECT
7 UNTIL 180 DAYS AFTER ENACTMENT OF THE REPEALING STATUTE.
8 (2) WITHDRAWAL SHALL NOT AFFECT THE CONTINUING
9 REQUIREMENT OF THE WITHDRAWING STATE’S LICENSING AUTHORITY TO COMPLY
10 WITH THE INVESTIGATIVE AND ADVERSE ACTION REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF
11 THIS ACT PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF WITHDRAWAL.
12 (3) UPON THE ENACTMENT OF A STATUTE WITHDRAWING FROM THIS
13 COMPACT, A STATE SHALL IMMEDIATELY PROVIDE NOTICE OF SUCH WITHDRAWAL
14 TO ALL LICENSEES WITHIN THAT STATE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY SUBSEQUENT
15 STATUTORY ENACTMENT TO THE CONTRARY, SUCH WITHDRAWING STATE SHALL
16 CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE ALL LICENSES GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS COMPACT
17 FOR A MINIMUM OF 180 DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF SUCH NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL.
18 (C) NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS COMPACT SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO
19 INVALIDATE OR PREVENT ANY SOCIAL WORK LICENSURE AGREEMENT OR OTHER
20 COOPERATIVE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN A MEMBER STATE AND A NON–MEMBER
21 STATE THAT DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS COMPACT.
22 (D) THIS COMPACT MAY BE AMENDED BY THE MEMBER STATES. NO
23 AMENDMENT TO THE COMPACT SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE AND BINDING UPON ANY
24 MEMBER STATE UNTIL IT IS ENACTED INTO THE LAWS OF ALL MEMBER STATES.
25 SECTION 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY.
26 (A) THIS COMPACT AND THE COMMISSION’S RULEMAKING AUTHORITY
27 SHALL BE LIBERALLY CONSTRUED SO AS TO EFFECTUATE THE PURPOSES, AND THE
28 IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMPACT. PROVISIONS OF THE
29 COMPACT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZING OR REQUIRING THE PROMULGATION OF RULES
30 SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO LIMIT THE COMMISSION’S RULEMAKING AUTHORITY
31 SOLELY FOR THOSE PURPOSES.
32 (B) THE PROVISIONS OF THIS COMPACT SHALL BE SEVERABLE AND IF ANY
33 PHRASE, CLAUSE, SENTENCE OR PROVISION OF THIS COMPACT IS HELD BY A COURT
34 OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION TO BE CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF ANY
35 MEMBER STATE, A STATE SEEKING PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPACT, OR OF THE

HOUSE BILL 345 33
1 UNITED STATES, OR THE APPLICABILITY THEREOF TO ANY GOVERNMENT, AGENCY,
2 PERSON OR CIRCUMSTANCE IS HELD TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY A COURT OF

4 AND THE APPLICABILITY THEREOF TO ANY GOVERNMENT, AGENCY, PERSON, OR
5 CIRCUMSTANCE SHALL NOT BE AFFECTED THEREBY.
6 (C) NOTWITHSTANDING SUBSECTION (B) OF THIS SECTION, THE
7 COMMISSION MAY DENY A STATE’S PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPACT OR, IN
8 ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION 13(B), TERMINATE A MEMBER
9 STATE’S PARTICIPATION IN THE COMPACT, IF IT DETERMINES THAT A
10 CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT OF A MEMBER STATE IS A MATERIAL DEPARTURE
11 FROM THE COMPACT. OTHERWISE, IF THIS COMPACT SHALL BE HELD TO BE
12 CONTRARY TO THE CONSTITUTION OF ANY MEMBER STATE, THE COMPACT SHALL
13 REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AS TO THE REMAINING MEMBER STATES AND
14 IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT AS TO THE MEMBER STATE AFFECTED AS TO ALL
15 SEVERABLE MATTERS.
