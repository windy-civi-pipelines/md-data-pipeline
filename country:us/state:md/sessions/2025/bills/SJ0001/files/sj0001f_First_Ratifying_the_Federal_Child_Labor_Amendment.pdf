2 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 1
1 WHEREAS, In 1937, when the most recent state ratified House Joint Resolution 184,
2 only 28 states had ratified it, which fell short of the three–fourths of states required to
3 ratify a constitutional amendment; and
4 WHEREAS, The proposal for the constitutional amendment is still outstanding since
5 Congress did not set a time limit for ratification, and ratification by 10 more states is
6 required to add the amendment proposed by House Joint Resolution 184 to the U.S.
7 Constitution; and
8 WHEREAS, On March 18, 1927, the 314th session of the Maryland General
9 Assembly rejected ratification of House Joint Resolution 184; and
10 WHEREAS, The 447th session of the Maryland General Assembly desires to correct
11 the mistake of its predecessor; and
12 WHEREAS, Since 2018, there has been a revived interest nationwide to ratify this
13 amendment, with ratification resolutions introduced in several states including New York,
14 Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Nebraska, a resolution to ratify House Joint Resolution 184
15 passing the Hawaii Senate in 2021 and 2022, and a resolution to ratify House Joint
16 Resolution 184 passing the Connecticut House of Representatives in 2024; and
17 WHEREAS, Regulating the labor of persons under the age of 18 years is necessary
18 to protect their health, welfare, and ability to obtain a quality education; and
19 WHEREAS, There has been a weakening of child labor protections in various states
20 and an increase in violations of existing laws; now, therefore, be it
21 RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That the Article
22 proposed as an amendment to the U.S. Constitution as set forth in U.S. House Joint
23 Resolution 184, dated June 2, 1924, is hereby ratified by the Maryland General Assembly;
24 and be it further
25 RESOLVED, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded by the Department of
26 Legislative Services to the President of the United States of America, 1600 Pennsylvania
27 Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20500; Vice President of the United States, President of the
28 United States Senate, Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510; the Honorable

30 Administration, 700 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20408; the Maryland

32 state of the United States, with the request that it be circulated among leadership of the
33 legislative branch of the state governments.
