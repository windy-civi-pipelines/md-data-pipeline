2025 Session
HB0055
Criminal Procedure - Expungement of Records - Good Cause
Bill Summary
This bill authorizes a person to file a petition for expungement of any misdemeanor or felony
conviction after the completion of the sentence, parole, probation, and any other form of mandatory
treatment associated with the conviction. A court may grant a petition for expungement under the
bill at any time on a showing of good cause.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill would allow petitions for expungement of any misdemeanor or felony conviction on the
basis of good cause as determined by a court. This could help mitigate the adverse impacts
resulting from a conviction such as difficulty obtaining employment, housing, education, licensing,
and other government services as a result of a criminal record. There is no data available to measure
specific impacts, but national and State data confirm that Black individuals are overrepresented in
the criminal justice system and often experience higher rates of unemployment. Individuals with
criminal convictions not covered under current expungement rules would benefit to the extent that
they take advantage of expungement opportunities offered by the bill’s expanded good cause
considerations.
Analysis
The bill expands opportunities for expungement by authorizing a person to file a petition for
expungement of any misdemeanor or felony conviction after the completion of the sentence,
parole, probation, and any other form of mandatory treatment associated with the conviction. A
court may grant a petition for expungement under the bill at any time on a showing of good cause.
The court must consider (1) the nature of the crime; (2) the person’s character and history; (3) the
person’s risk to public safety; (4) any successful rehabilitation; (5) the amount of time since the
HB 55/ Page 1

conviction; and (6) the impact the charge has on the person’s ability to secure employment,
education, housing, public assistance, licensing, and opportunities for economic stability. While
an individual may petition the court once every five years for a specific charge, denials by the
court of good cause expungements cannot be appealed and the person may not file a subsequent
petition for expungement under this section for the same conviction for at least another five years.
Expungements – Section 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article
In general, a person seeking expungement of records pertaining to a criminal charge must file a
petition for expungement with the court under § 10-105 or § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure
Article. With some exceptions, § 10-105 applies to dispositions other than a conviction, and
§ 10-110 applies to expungements of convictions.
Section 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article authorizes an individual convicted of any of a
list of approximately 100 specified offenses, or an attempt, a conspiracy, or a solicitation of any
of these offenses, to file a petition for expungement of the conviction, subject to specified
procedures and requirements.
While petitioners under both statutes must comply with specified waiting periods, a court is
authorized to grant a petition for expungement under § 10-105(c)(9) of the Criminal Procedure
Article at any time on a showing of good cause for dispositions other than a conviction.
Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Record
Expungement, in general, is intended to help mitigate the adverse consequences of having a
criminal record, which can last beyond imprisonment, fines, and the legal process and can include
the denial of civil opportunities and benefits available to a person due to their record. Specifically,
having a criminal history can adversely affect employment prospects which can further influence
an individual’s level of income, housing opportunities, and access to quality health care.
Employment is key to stable housing and homeownership and a variety of State and national data
shows that higher incomes can lead to the stability and consistency necessary to accumulate the
various upfront resources needed to buy a home. Monetary savings for down payments and good
credit scores are necessary to achieve initial homeownership and are largely driven by an
individual’s employment status and level of income. Employment also often dictates one’s access
to health care. Certain jobs do not offer health insurance benefits and access to jobs with such
benefits may be restricted by an attachment to a criminal record. A criminal record can therefore
impose significant barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility.
Impacts of the Bill
According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, there were 46,251 petitions for expungement
in Maryland’s circuit courts and the District Court in fiscal 2023 – a sizable increase from the
38,448 expungement petitions in fiscal 2022 following the legislative expansion of eligibility for
expungement. There is currently no demographic data available that indicates the racial and ethnic
composition of individuals impacted by expungement.

National and State data consistently show that racial minorities experience disproportionate levels
of adversity in the areas of life affected by a criminal record. National studies have found that there
is a significant negative effect of having a criminal record on employment outcomes that appears
substantially larger for Black individuals. Exhibit 1 shows that in 2023, the unemployment rate in
Maryland was highest among Black job seekers and nearly twice the rate of white job seekers in
the State.

The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services reports that, as of January 1, 2025,
Black individuals made up 71% of Maryland’s prison population contrasted with their 29% share
of the State’s overall population.
The bill’s good cause expungement provisions will likely impact Black individuals to a greater
extent as these individuals are overrepresented in charges, arrests, and incarceration for many
crimes at a disproportionately high rate, making them also disproportionately affected by the
collateral consequences of criminal records, which is specifically taken into consideration under
the good cause process.

Conclusion
The bill’s provisions expanding opportunities for expungement and good cause criteria will enable
successful applicants to refrain from disclosing certain convictions and contacts that may prevent
them from achieving employment and all the ancillary benefits and opportunities that come with
it, such as improved housing and health care opportunities. The provisions of the bill will likely
impact Black individuals to a greater extent as these individuals are incarcerated at
disproportionately high rates in Maryland. The exact equity impacts of the bill cannot be estimated
without additional data, including historical demographic data on expungement applicants,
individuals eligible for expungement under the bill, and prospective employment data for
individuals with expunged records. Additionally, future equity analysis may benefit from the
disclosure of demographic data of those granted expungement on the grounds of showing good
cause.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
