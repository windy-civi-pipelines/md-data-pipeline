20 Preamble
21 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,
22 is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and
23 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the
24 State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are
25 irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events,
26 flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and
27 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of
28 climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new
29 or upgraded infrastructure; and
30 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette
31 Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public
32 welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and
33 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great
34 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel
35 companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require
36 compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time
37 period; now, therefore,

20 Preamble
21 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,
22 is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and
23 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the
24 State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are
25 irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events,
26 flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and
27 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of
28 climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new
29 or upgraded infrastructure; and
30 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette
31 Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public
32 welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and
33 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great
34 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel
35 companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require
36 compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time
37 period; now, therefore,
