8 Preamble
9 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,
10 is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and
11 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the
12 State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are
13 irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events,
14 flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and
15 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of
16 climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new
17 or upgraded infrastructure; and
18 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette
19 Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public
20 welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and
21 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great
22 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel
23 companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require
24 compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time
25 period; now, therefore,

8 Preamble
9 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,
10 is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and
11 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the
12 State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are
13 irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events,
14 flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and
15 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of
16 climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new
17 or upgraded infrastructure; and
18 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette
19 Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public
20 welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and
21 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great
22 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel
23 companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require
24 compensation from companies commensurate with their emissions during a given time
25 period; now, therefore,
