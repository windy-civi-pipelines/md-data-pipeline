HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 A House Joint Resolution concerning
3 Resolution 2758 to Delegitimize Taiwan
4 FOR the purpose of opposing the People’s Republic of China’s misuse of United Nations
5 Resolution 2758 to delegitimize Taiwan; and generally relating to support of Taiwan.
6 WHEREAS, The Republic of China (Taiwan) was one of the 51 original member
7 states of the United Nations (UN) at its inception in 1945; and
8 WHEREAS, On October 25, 1971, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)
9 adopted Resolution 2758, which recognizes the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the
10 representative of the member state “China” in the UN; and
11 WHEREAS, The sole purpose of Resolution 2758 was to address the question of
12 which government would represent the seat in the UN for China and was never intended
13 to address any other topic including those related to Taiwan’s ultimate political status; and
14 WHEREAS, The PRC frequently conflates Resolution 2758 with its “One China
15 Principle” (OCP), which is a policy held by the Chinese Communist Party alleging that the
16 PRC is the only sovereign nation using the name “China” and that Taiwan is an inalienable
17 part of China; and
18 WHEREAS, PRC officials misrepresent Resolution 2758, claiming that the adoption
19 of the resolution implies acceptance of the PRC’s OCP including the PRC claims to Taiwan
20 despite the fact that Resolution 2758 does not and was never meant to represent an
21 international consensus regarding Taiwan and whether or not it is a part of the PRC; and
22 WHEREAS, The PRC misleadingly claims that countries with a “One China Policy”
23 have accepted and abide by the PRC OCP and has misused Resolution 2758 to influence 10
24 countries since 2016 to change their diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the PRC; and
*hj0007*
2 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 7
1 WHEREAS, The One China Policy of the United States does acknowledge the PRC’s
2 OCP; however, it affirms that: (1) the United States does not take a position on Taiwan’s
3 status and (2) this issue should be resolved peacefully by the people on both sides of the
4 Taiwan Strait; and
5 WHEREAS, In 1982, the United States conveyed the Six Assurances to the Republic
6 of China President Chiang Ching–kuo, including that the United States had not changed
7 its stance on Taiwan’s sovereignty, and with each successive presidential administration
8 the Six Assurances have been reaffirmed; and
9 WHEREAS, The PRC has weaponized Resolution 2758 and the OCP to isolate and
10 delegitimize Taiwan globally and to prevent its participation at the UN, UN–affiliated
11 agencies, and other international organizations, including the International Civil Aviation
12 Organization and Interpol; and
13 WHEREAS, Former U.S. officials have observed that the PRC manipulates
14 Resolution 2758 to make false claims regarding Taiwan’s status in order to undermine the
15 international order and the international system; and
16 WHEREAS, The PRC’s strategy of disseminating disinformation about the scope and
17 purpose of Resolution 2758 is succeeding with some UN members refusing to support
18 Taiwan’s participation in UN entities, including the expulsion of Taiwan from the Central
19 American Parliament after 20 years as a permanent observer and the routing of
20 communications to Taiwan through the PRC; and
21 WHEREAS, U.S. Department of State officials have made statements making the
22 following observations: (1) Resolution 2758 did not endorse, is not equivalent to, and does
23 not reflect a consensus for China’s OCP, a term that refers to the PRC’s own position on
24 Taiwan; (2) Resolution 2758 has no bearing on countries’ sovereign choices with respect to
25 their relationships with Taiwan; (3) Resolution 2758 did not constitute a UN institutional
26 position on the ultimate political status of Taiwan; and (4) Resolution 2758 does not
27 preclude Taiwan’s meaningful participation in the UN system and other multilateral
28 forums; and
29 WHEREAS, For the third time and for 2 consecutive years, most recently in October
30 2024, the U.S. Department of State sent a letter to state officials, city mayors, and Fortune
31 500 CEOs urging them to deepen their relationship with Taiwan in areas such as trade,
32 education, investment, and tourism; and
33 WHEREAS, U.S. allies including Australia, Canada, the European Parliament, the
34 Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have rejected the PRC’s attempt to distort
35 Resolution 2758 to exclude Taiwan from UN participation; and
36 WHEREAS, The PRC’s weaponization of Resolution 2758 includes threats to Taipei
37 that if Taiwan does not clarify UN member states’ understanding of the resolution, Beijing
38 might overturn the cross–Strait status quo; and
HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 7 3
1 WHEREAS, The government of Taiwan appealed to the UNGA for greater inclusion
2 at the 79th UNGA in September 2024 which featured the theme “Leaving no one behind:
3 acting together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development and human dignity
4 for present and future generations”; and
5 WHEREAS, The PRC’s weaponization of Resolution 2758 has left behind Taiwan’s
6 23.5 million people since 1971; now, therefore, be it
7 RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That the General
8 Assembly calls on the UN to oppose the misuse of Resolution 2758 by the PRC and for the
9 UN to cease using Resolution 2758 to deny Taiwan participation in UN institutions; and be
10 it further
11 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly calls on the UN Secretariat to remain
12 neutral and to cease citing Resolution 2758 to prevent Taiwanese nationals and news media
13 from visiting UN buildings or attending or covering UN conferences and events; and be it
14 further
15 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly reaffirms that the longstanding One China
16 Policy of the United States does not recognize the PRC’s claim of control over Taiwan and
17 its outlying islands and reaffirms the interest of the United States in a peaceful resolution
18 of cross–Strait issues; and be it further
19 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly has not agreed to take any position
20 regarding sovereignty over Taiwan and will not exert pressure on Taiwan to enter into
21 negotiations with the PRC; and be it further
22 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly reaffirms that the One China Policy of the
23 United States and similar policies of its partners are not equivalent to the OCP of the
24 Chinese Communist Party; and be it further
25 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly emphasizes that Resolution 2758 is not
26 equivalent to, and does not endorse or reflect, the PRC’s OCP; and be it further
27 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly emphasizes further that Resolution 2758
28 does not take a position on Taiwan’s ultimate political status, as explicitly recognized by
29 the PRC leaders at the time and does not represent a UN consensus on Taiwan’s status;
30 and be it further
31 RESOLVED, That the General Assembly opposes China’s distortion of Resolution
32 2758, which is wrongfully conflated with the so–called OCP; and be it further

34 continuing official relationships with Taiwan and other nations across the world in
35 strengthening their partnership with Taiwan; and be it further

6 with partners on joint efforts to counter China’s false narratives about Resolution 2758;
