Preamble
WHEREAS, Chromite was first discovered in the United States by Isaac Tyson, Jr.,
in Bare Hills, Baltimore County in 1808; and
WHEREAS, This ore of the important metal chromium appeared as heavy black sand
in the streams and gullies of Maryland’s serpentine barrens, or as heavy dark rocks found
on the surface; and
WHEREAS, Later discoveries of the mineral were found in the serpentine barrens
of Harford County, Cecil County, Soldier’s Delight of Baltimore County, and southeastern
Pennsylvania; and
WHEREAS, Until the 1850s, this region provided most of the world’s chromite, as
Isaac Tyson, Jr., exported the valuable mineral via Baltimore Clipper ships from Fells Point
in Baltimore; and
WHEREAS, Isaac Tyson, Jr., established the Baltimore Chrome Works, the nation’s
first chromium chemicals plant in the United States, dominated the chrome industry,
started the renowned Tyson Mining Company, and was inducted into the National Mining
Hall of Fame and Museum in 1996; and
WHEREAS, Chromite is found in Baltimore, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, and
Montgomery counties and its historical relevance is reflected in the naming of local interest
points, such as Chrome Hill in Harford County, Chromine Road in Baltimore County, and
Chrome Mine Road in Montgomery County; and
WHEREAS, Chromite reflects the nature of Maryland’s rich mining history and vast
mineral resources; now, therefore,
