3 FOR the purpose of urging the U.S. Congress to enact federal legislation to establish a
4 national infrastructure bank; and generally relating to a national infrastructure
5 bank.
6 WHEREAS, The United States of America lacks critical investment in infrastructure
7 projects; and
8 WHEREAS, The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), in its 2021 report card,
9 assigned the United States a grade of C– regarding the then–current state of
10 infrastructure, and estimated that more than $6 trillion would be needed to restore the
11 nation’s infrastructure to a state of good repair, of which $3 trillion was then unfunded and
12 the remainder was inadequately funded, with new 21st–century projects also unfunded;
13 and
14 WHEREAS, Maryland is in dire need of substantial infrastructure investment and
15 improvement to protect the State’s economy and improve its quality of life; and
16 WHEREAS, According to the American Road and Transportation Builders
17 Association (ARTBA), Maryland has 1,595 bridges in need of repairs, and following the
18 collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge, there are now 305 “fracture critical” bridges
19 standing in Maryland; and
20 WHEREAS, Maryland’s drinking water infrastructure is aging, with Baltimore City
21 recently averaging 1,000 water breaks per year, stormwater repair and replacement
22 potentially costing $3 billion, and the replacement of lead water service lines projected to
23 cost more than $75 million; and
24 WHEREAS, Maryland needs at least 150,000 new units of affordable housing to
25 address the needs of its most housing–insecure residents; and

1 WHEREAS, Traffic congestion in the Baltimore metropolitan area costs each driver
2 $1,371 per year in lost time and wasted fuel, and the average driver in the Washington
3 D.C. suburban area loses 100 hours per year due to traffic, with a cost of $2,465 per driver
4 per year, and statewide, drivers lose $5.8 billion each year in lost time and fuel due to
5 congestion; and
6 WHEREAS, Congress has introduced H.R. 4052, the “National Infrastructure Bank
7 Act”, which would create a $5 trillion bank to finance all infrastructure requirements,
8 including bringing the nation’s infrastructure to a state of good repair and building new
9 projects; and
10 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank is modeled on previous banks that
11 helped build much of the nation’s infrastructure under Presidents George Washington,
12 John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the last such bank
13 played a key role in lifting the nation out of the Great Depression and supporting efforts
14 during World War II; and
15 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank is projected to create 25 million new
16 jobs, pay Davis–Bacon wages, enforce Buy America provisions, ensure significant
17 disbursements to disadvantaged business enterprises, and mandate large–scale minority
18 hiring, all without requiring new federal spending or taxes, and according to experts, is
19 expected to grow the economy by 5% per year, as previous infrastructure banks did; and
20 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank will collaborate with states to finance
21 the total buildout of broadband, repair all roads and bridges, expand the power grid, fix all
22 drinking water and wastewater systems, invest in affordable housing, replace all lead
23 water service lines, expand mass transit, finance the capital needs of the Washington Metro
24 system, fund high–speed rail in the Northeast Corridor, and more; and
25 WHEREAS, The National Infrastructure Bank is overwhelmingly supported, with
26 28 state legislatures that have introduced or passed resolutions of support, as well as
27 county and city councils, and national organizations such as the National Black Caucus of
28 State Legislators, the National Hispanic Caucus of State Legislators, the National
