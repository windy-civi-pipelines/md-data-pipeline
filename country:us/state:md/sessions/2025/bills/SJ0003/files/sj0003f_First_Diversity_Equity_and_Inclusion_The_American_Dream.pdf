SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 A Senate Joint Resolution concerning
2 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion – The American Dream
3 FOR the purpose of affirming Maryland’s commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
4 (DEI) as a foundation of the American Dream; encouraging certain individuals and
5 groups to adopt and uphold DEI principles; and generally relating to the American
6 Dream and DEI.
7 WHEREAS, For generations the American Dream has been a beacon of hope; and
8 WHEREAS, The American Dream embodies the ideals of opportunity, prosperity,
9 and upward mobility, promising that every person should have the chance to achieve what
10 they themselves define as success and fulfillment through hard work and determination;
11 and
12 WHEREAS, Many today feel as though their American Dream is unattainable; and
13 WHEREAS, The American Dream belongs to all of us, not just billionaires and
14 multimillionaires; and
15 WHEREAS, Our highest accomplishments as a state and nation have been achieved
16 when we harnessed the strengths of all people, regardless of their identities, to overcome
17 our greatest challenges; and
18 WHEREAS, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) is a centuries–old movement
19 deeply rooted in America’s founding principles and its subsequent legacy of civil rights and
20 social justice efforts aimed at delivering the laws, policies, and initiatives that enable
21 America to live up to our Constitution’s promises; and
22 WHEREAS, DEI policies, from the 19th Amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964
23 to the Americans with Disabilities Act, among others, reflect the corrective legislative and
24 legal actions taken across our nation’s history to expand and guarantee access to the
25 educational, economic, and civic obligations and capacities of our nation; and

2 SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 3
1 WHEREAS, DEI principles and policies promote equal access to opportunities, foster
2 an environment of respect and belonging, and ensure that every individual – regardless of
3 background – can fully participate in all aspects of society; and
4 WHEREAS, DEI is essential to creating a society where all individuals are valued,
5 heard, and included; and
6 WHEREAS, DEI is based on removing barriers to opportunity so that our merits can
7 speak for themselves; and
8 WHEREAS, DEI is committed to widening pathways to the American Dream for
9 every community so that all people can reap the benefits of shared prosperity in our nation;
10 and
11 WHEREAS, Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental constitutional
12 rights, protecting the ability of individuals to voice their ideas and opinions without
13 interference, punishment, or retaliation by the government; and
14 WHEREAS, Anti–DEI activists, politicians, and corporate decision–makers who
15 attempt to prohibit DEI infringe upon the right of individuals to freely express themselves,
16 diminish the diversity of perspectives that strengthen our society, and conflict with
17 antidiscrimination laws; and
18 WHEREAS, Efforts to attack DEI are harmful to the bottom line and health of our
19 economy; now, therefore, be it
20 RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That Maryland
21 affirms its commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as an essential foundation for
22 achieving the American Dream and fostering environments where all individuals have the
23 freedom to be healthy, prosperous, and safe, and the opportunity to realize their full
24 potential; and be it further
25 RESOLVED, That Maryland encourages local, State, and federal policymakers,
26 educational institutions, workplaces, and other organizations to adopt and uphold DEI
27 principles that promote inclusivity, protect freedom of expression, remove barriers, and
28 provide equitable opportunities for all individuals to pursue their dreams; and be it further
29 RESOLVED, That certified copies of this Resolution be sent by the Secretary of State
