19 (2) (i) The value remaining after making the deductions shall be
20 divided into an operating real property value and an operating personal property value, as
21 determined by the Department.
22 (ii) The value of operating real property is the assessment of
23 operating real property of a public utility.
24 (iii) The value of operating personal property is the assessment of
25 operating personal property of a public utility.
26 (3) Operating land of a public utility is valued and assessed by the

7 federal government, such as the Maryland Public Service Commission, the Federal
8 Communications Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission;
9 (ii) uses a significant portion of the real and personal property used
