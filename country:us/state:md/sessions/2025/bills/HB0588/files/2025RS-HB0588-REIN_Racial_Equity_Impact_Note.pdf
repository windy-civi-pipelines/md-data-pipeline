2025 Session
HB0588
Juveniles - Reportable Offenses
Bill Summary
This bill requires the Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), for students committed to its custody,
to notify the local superintendent and the school principal of a school in which the student has
enrolled or to which the student has been transferred of (1) the student’s arrest for a reportable
offense or an offense that is related to the student’s membership in a criminal organization and
(2) the disposition of the reportable offense. DJS must also provide information regarding any
educational programming and related services provided to the student.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s provisions require DJS to (1) notify school officials of arrests for reportable offenses by
students in their custody; (2) report on the dispositions of these arrests; and (3) report information
regarding any educational programming or other related services a student has received while in
DJS custody. This will provide crucial information for school officials to facilitate an affected
student’s return to in-person learning. The bill would also ensure the prompt return to regular
in-school programming for students that were not formally processed by DJS or adjudicated
delinquent, but were removed from in-person learning or otherwise disciplined following an arrest.
Black students are mostly likely to benefit from the provisions of the bill as they are
overrepresented in reportable offense arrests and school suspensions and expulsions.
Analysis
The bill’s provisions would require DJS to notify school officials of reportable offense arrests for
students in their custody and report back the disposition of any charges related to that student’s
arrest. The bill also extends various provisions of current law regarding the permissible treatment
HB 588/ Page 1

of information obtained about a reportable offen se and inclusion of the reportable offense data
collected under the bill within existing annual reporting requirements.
Under existing law, a reportable offense is an offense that (1) occurred off school premises; (2) did
not occur at an event sponsored by the school; and (3) includes a crime of violence, as specified in
current law, and numerous other specified weapons, drug, assault, and theft-related offenses. When
a student is arrested for a reportable offense or an offense related to the student’s membership in a
criminal organization, the law enforcement agency making the arrest must notify (1) the local
superintendent; (2) the school principal; and (3) if appropriate, the school security officer. The law
enforcement agency may also notify the State’s Attorney.
In 2022, the General Assembly expressed concern about the purported misuse or overuse of school
removals for students arrested for a reportable offense. Chapter 742 of 2022 clarifies that a
“reportable offense” as it relates to students in public or nonpublic schools is an offense that
occurred off school premises and did not occur at an event sponsored by the school. The Act also
requires that students accused of reportable offenses be disciplined according to existing State
regulations and provides for additional due process accommodations by allowing a student accused
of a reportable offense to have an attorney attend the conference between the student or parent and
principal or county superintendent.
Juvenile Intake Process
The intake process for juveniles accused of any criminal offense requires a determination as to
whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction and whether judicial action is in the best interest of the
public and/or the child. DJS intake officers are authorized to (1) disapprove a complaint as legally
insufficient; (2) resolve the matter at intake with or without services; (3) propose an informal
adjustment period (also called pre-court supervision); or (4) authorize the filing of a petition by
the State’s Attorney’s Office. While DJS can informally handle all complaints, violent felonies
and handgun violations must be reviewed by the State’s Attorney and approved for informal
adjustment/pre-court supervision. Informal adjustments serve to divert youth from formal juvenile
court processing.
Alternative Education for Students Prohibited from In-person School Attendance
Under current law, students prohibited from in-person school attendance must be presented with
alternative education options. The Juvenile Services Education Program (JSEP) is an independent
education program housed in DJS that provides comprehensive educational services to all students
in DJS detention and/or residential facilities. JSEP coursework is aligned with the Maryland State
Department of Education (MSDE) standards and each student is enrolled in classes which meet
their graduation requirements. Through JSEP, students may receive career and technology
education certifications, specialized instruction, participate in GED completion, receive
comprehensive school counseling support, and post-secondary opportunities. JSEP also includes
instruction in core content subjects, library/media services, life skills, and special education
services.

Impacts of the Bill
MSDE reported 986 reportable offense incidents during the 2022-2023 school year. Of these
incidents, 65% involved Black students, 18% were white, 9% were Hispanic, and 6% involved
students of two or more races. Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, and Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders account for less than 2% of the total. Exhibit 1 shows the racial and
ethnic breakdowns for reportable offenses compared to each group’s share of the State’s public
school population during the same time period.

In addition, MSDE 2022-2023 school year data shows that there were 69,274 suspensions and/or
expulsions for major offenses, several of which would be considered a reportable offense requiring
notification of specified school officials under current law. Black students comprised 33% of the
overall school enrollment but accounted for 58% of all suspensions and expulsions compared to
their white counterparts that accounted for 21% of suspensions and expulsions and 33% of school
enrollment.
The bill’s notification provisions regarding a student’s disposition after their arrest for a reportable
offense may benefit any student arrested for specified offenses by permitting their prompt return
to school upon a favorable disposition. Black students in particular may be impacted the most, as
they make up a disproportionately large number of out-of-school suspensions and expulsions. In
HB 588/ Page 3

the instance where an arrested student is subjec t to intake by DJS and potentially adjudicated
delinquent, the bill would provide school officials with critical educational programming
information should the student return to in-person schooling.
Conclusion
The bill’s requirement for DJS to notify school officials of certain post-arrest outcomes for
reportable offense arrests would benefit the affected students by allowing a faster return to regular
school programming in those cases where an arrested student is not referred to formal proceedings.
Black students in particular may be impacted to the greatest extent as they make up a large portion
of reportable offense arrests as well as out of school suspensions and expulsions in general. The
specific impacts, however, cannot be determined without more longitudinal data on arrest
outcomes.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
