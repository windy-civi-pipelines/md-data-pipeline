4 (V) The Commission may not issue a certificate of public convenience
5 and necessity for the construction of an overhead transmission line in the electric
6 distribution service territory of an electric company to an applicant other than an electric
7 company if:
8 1. the overhead transmission line is to be located solely
9 within the electric distribution service territory of that electric company; and
10 2. the cost of the overhead transmission line is to be paid
11 solely by that electric company and its ratepayers.
12 [(v)] (VI) 1. This subparagraph applies to the construction of an
13 overhead transmission line for which a certificate of public convenience and necessity is
14 required under this section.

18 right necessary for the construction or maintenance of the transmission line.
19 (4) (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, for
20 construction related to an existing overhead transmission line designed to carry a voltage
21 in excess of 69,000 volts, the Commission shall waive the requirement to obtain a certificate
22 of public convenience and necessity if the Commission finds that the construction does not:
23 1. require the person to obtain new real property or
24 additional rights–of–way through eminent domain; or
25 2. require larger or higher structures to accommodate:
26 A. increased voltage; or
27 B. larger conductors.
28 (ii) 1. For construction related to an existing overhead
29 transmission line, including repairs, that is necessary to avoid an imminent safety hazard
