27 Comptroller of the Treasurer’s determination and the Comptroller shall credit the premium
28 accordingly. Premium from the sale of bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 that is not
29 transferred to the Annuity Bond Fund may, upon approval of the Board of Public Works, be
30 expended by the Comptroller for any of the public purposes set forth in Section 1(3) of this
