28 of the unexpended or unencumbered authorization shall be canceled and be of no further
29 force and effect. If bonds have been issued for the loan, the amount of unexpended or

18 (ii) The justification that the proposed use of the funds is consistent
19 with the public purpose of the appropriation.
20 (c) (i) The Office of Policy Analysis shall have 45 days to review and
21 comment on the proposed use of the funds.
22 (ii) If the Office of Policy Analysis does not submit written objections

26 of this Act.
27 (d) It is the intent of the General Assembly that the provisions of this
28 paragraph:

33 Capital Bond Loans.

5 issuance of State bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the Treasurer shall notify the
6 Comptroller of the Treasurer’s determination and the Comptroller shall credit the premium
7 accordingly. Premium from the sale of bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 that is not
8 transferred to the Annuity Bond Fund may, upon approval of the Board of Public Works, be
9 expended by the Comptroller for any of the public purposes set forth in Section 1(3) of this
10 Act, including any applicable architects’ and engineers’ fees.

18 (ii) The justification that the proposed use of the funds is consistent
19 with the public purpose of the appropriation.
20 (c) (i) The Office of Policy Analysis shall have 45 days to review and
21 comment on the proposed use of the funds.
22 (ii) If the Office of Policy Analysis does not submit written objections

5 issuance of State bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, the Treasurer shall notify the
6 Comptroller of the Treasurer’s determination and the Comptroller shall credit the premium
7 accordingly. Premium from the sale of bonds in fiscal years 2024 and 2025 that is not
8 transferred to the Annuity Bond Fund may, upon approval of the Board of Public Works, be
9 expended by the Comptroller for any of the public purposes set forth in Section 1(3) of this
10 Act, including any applicable architects’ and engineers’ fees.
