Section 1:
2025 Session
HB0620
Bill Summary
This bill alters the definition of “reportable offense” to be only a crime of violence as defined by
the Criminal Law Article. Therefore, law enforcement agencies are subject to notification
requirements in current law when they arrest a student only for a crime of violence and not for
other crimes currently included in the definition of a “reportable offense.”
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill will limit the number of offenses that require law enforcement officers to notify school
officials when they arrest a student to only offenses defined as a crime of violence in § 14-101 of
the Criminal Law Article. This would reduce the current list of reportable offenses by at least 11
offenses. By way of example, the bill would have reduced the number of offenses reported during
the 2022-2023 school year by 41%. Data shows that Black students are overrepresented in arrests
for reportable offenses under existing law, and Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) data
confirms that Black juveniles are overwhelmingly charged, arrested, and adjudicated delinquent
for crimes of violence in the juvenile court. Thus, the bill will likely reduce the overall number of
students affected by reportable offense reporting and thereby reduce any associated disciplinary
measures. Additional data is needed to understand the exact nature and magnitude of the bill’s
impacts on racial equity overall, including demographic data on each of the offenses removed from
the reporting requirements as well as data on the public safety effects of the bill and how those
relate to the overall equity impacts.
Analysis
The bill would require law enforcement to report arrests of students for only crimes of violence
listed in § 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article.
HB 620/ Page 1
Reportable Offenses
Under existing law, a reportable offense is an offense that (1) occurred off school premises; (2) did
not occur at an event sponsored by the school; and (3) includes a crime of violence, as specified in
current law, and numerous other specified weapons, drug, assault, and theft-related offenses. When
a student is arrested for a reportable offense or an offense related to the student’s membership in a
criminal organization, the law enforcement agency making the arrest must notify (1) the local
superintendent; (2) the school principal; and (3) if appropriate, the school security officer. The law
enforcement agency may also notify the State’s Attorney.
In 2022, the General Assembly expressed concern about the purported misuse or overuse of school
removals for students arrested for a reportable offense. Chapter 742 of 2022 clarifies that a
“reportable offense” as it relates to students in public or nonpublic schools is an offense that
occurred off school premises and did not occur at an event sponsored by the school. The Act also
requires that students accused of reportable offenses be disciplined according to existing State
regulations and provides for additional due process accommodations by allowing a student accused
of a reportable offense to have an attorney attend the conference between the student or parent and
principal or county superintendent.
The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) is required to report to the General
Assembly annually (on or before December 30 each year) specified information about each
reportable offense for which a local school has received information in the previous school year.
Exhibit 1 lists and sorts reportable offenses under existing law based on whether they are defined
as a crime of violence under § 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article.

Suspensions and Expulsions in General
In accordance with rules developed by each local school board, a principal may suspend a student
for cause for up to 10 school days. The principal must provide the suspended student and the
student’s parents with a conference during the suspension period and a list of community
resources. Upon request by a principal, a local superintendent may suspend a student for more than
10 days or expel a student, subject to investigation, conferencing, and appeal procedures in statute.
A student may not be suspended or expelled only for attendance-related offenses but may be
subject to in-school suspension for those offenses.
A student who has been suspended or expelled may not return to the classroom until the principal
confers with (1) the teacher(s) who referred the student (if appropriate); (2) other appropriate
school personnel; (3) the student; and (4) the student’s parent or guardian.
If disruptive behavior results in action less than suspension, the principal or designee must confer
with the teacher who referred the student prior to the student returning to the teacher’s classroom.
Addressing Disproportionate and Discrepant Impacts of School Discipline
State regulations require MSDE to develop a method to analyze local school system discipline data
to determine whether there is a disproportionate impact on minority students. MSDE may use the
discrepancy model to assess the impact of discipline on special education students. The
discrepancy model uses a risk ratio of 3.0 as the threshold for determining whether
disproportionality exists; a risk ratio of 3.0 means that a target population (e.g., Black males) is
three times more likely than a control population (e.g., all other males) to be identified for special
education services or disciplined in some manner. A risk ratio greater than 1.0 indicates
overrepresentation. If MSDE identifies a school’s discipline process as having a disproportionate
impact on minority students or a discrepant impact on special education students, the local school
system must prepare and present to the State board a plan to reduce the impact within one year and
eliminate it within three years. A local school system must report its progress annually to the State
board.
Impacts of the Bill
Black juveniles are overrepresented in on-campus and off-campus arrests for reportable offenses
as defined under existing law. MSDE reported 986 reportable offense incidents during the
2022-2023 school year. Reportable offense incidents refer to events during which one or more
reportable offenses are reported. Of these incidents, 65% involved Black students, 18% were
white, 9% were Hispanic, and 6% involved students of two or more races. Asian, American Indian
or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders accounted for less than 2% of the total.
Exhibit 2 shows the racial and ethnic breakdowns for reportable offenses compared to each
group’s share of the State’s public school population during the same time period.

MSDE also tracks arrests that occurred as a result of a referral of a student by school personnel to
law enforcement or to DJS for a disciplinary offense that occurred on school grounds or during
off-campus activities, including transportation to and from school. Exhibit 3 shows the racial and
ethnic breakdown of on-campus school arrests during the 2022-2023 school year compared to
enrollment data. Offense categories include sex offenses, weapons violations, threats, serious
bodily injury, fighting, and alcohol and drug violations. The data shows 57% of arrestees were
Black students, 25% were white, 9% were Hispanic, and 8% were students of two or more races.
Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders account for
less than 2% of the total.

Exhibit 4 shows the breakdown of reportable offenses for the 2022-2023 school year grouped by
crimes of violence as defined under the bill versus those offenses not covered by the bill. It is
important to note that one reportable offense incident could have several offenses associated with
it. For example, a student who is charged with burglary may also be charged with drug possession
(a second offense) as part of the one incident. Despite the incident resulting in multiple charges
for multiple offenses, MSDE considers it a singular reportable offense incident.
The data shows that 986 singular reportable offense incidents involved a total of 1,231 offenses.
Of those offenses, 500, or 41%, were for crimes that did not fall under the crimes of violence
definition stipulated in § 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article. Under the bill, those offenses would
not be included as crimes that are subject to the notification requirements under current law.
The MSDE data does not provide demographic information to determine the racial makeup of the
juveniles responsible for crimes of violence versus all other offenses, but DJS intake data
demonstrates that Black juveniles are significantly overrepresented in both intakes and
adjudications for crimes of violence. In fiscal 2024, DJS reported a total of 2,482 intakes for
charges relating to crimes of violence, with youth of color accounting for 88% of this total and
89% of adjudications of delinquency by the juvenile court. DJS does not currently distinguish
between racial minorities in its offense reporting, thus the offense data groups all racial minorities
into the youth of color category. Black juveniles do, however, make up a significant portion of the
youth of color category as DJS does partially breakdown the category for total intakes. DJS data
HB 620/ Page 5
from fiscal 2022 through 2024 shows that Black juveniles made up 85% of total youth of color
intakes.

Conclusion
Arrest data from MSDE confirms significant disparities among racial groups arrested for
reportable offenses both on and off-campus, particularly for Black students. Additionally, there is
substantial evidence that Black juveniles are overwhelmingly charged, arrested, and adjudicated
for crimes of violence specifically. Based on the data that is reported, it is likely that the bill’s
alteration of the definition of reportable offenses would result in an overall reduction of any
associated discipline or programmatic changes to a student’s education program. Additional data
would be needed to understand the specific impacts for students and the magnitude of those
impacts, including data regarding the racial and ethnic distribution of individual reportable offense
incidents.
Removing offenses from the reporting requirements could also affect public safety and limit
needed support from school staff and officials who may not be aware of a student’s behavioral
issues. The overall equity impacts of this bill encompass weighing the public safety impacts on the
student population as well as the quality and extent of the support, intervention, and restorative
practices provided by a school for students arrested for reportable offenses under existing law.
Additional data would be needed to understand the interplay between these considerations.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
