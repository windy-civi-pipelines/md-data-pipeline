33 agreements the same security given by the County to bondholders for the performance by
34 the County of its monetary obligations under the bonds.
35 If the County determines in the resolution to offer any of the bonds by solicitation of
36 competitive bids at public sale, the resolution shall fix the terms and conditions of the public

8 make loans to volunteer fire departments for the financing of fire or emergency–related
9 equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire departments in the County for
10 which the bonds are sold. If the amounts borrowed shall prove inadequate to finance the
11 projects described in the resolution, the County may issue additional bonds with the
12 limitations hereof for the purpose of evidencing the borrowing of additional funds for such
13 financing, provided the resolution authorizing the sale of additional bonds shall so recite,
14 but if the net proceeds of the sale of any issue of bonds exceed the amount needed to finance
15 the projects described in the resolution, the excess funds so borrowed and not expended
16 shall be applied to the payment of the next principal maturity of the bonds or to the
17 redemption of any part of the bonds which have been made redeemable or to the purchase
18 and cancellation of bonds, unless the County shall adopt a resolution allocating the excess
19 funds to the acquisition, construction, improvement, or development of other public
20 facilities, including water and sewer projects, or to the making of loans for fire or
21 emergency–related equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire departments
22 in the County, as defined and within the limits set forth in this Act.
23 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the bonds hereby authorized
24 shall constitute, and they shall so recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit

27 any of the bonds are outstanding, the County shall levy or cause to be levied ad valorem
28 taxes upon all the assessable property within the corporate limits of the County in rate and
29 amount sufficient to provide for or assure the payment, when due, of the principal of and
30 interest on all the bonds maturing in each such fiscal year and, in the event the proceeds
31 from the taxes so levied in any such fiscal year shall prove inadequate for such payment,
32 additional taxes shall be levied in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any such deficiency.
33 The County may apply to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued
34 hereunder any funds received by it as loan repayments from volunteer fire departments
35 and any funds received by it from the State of Maryland, the United States of America, any
36 agency or instrumentality thereof, or from any other source, if such funds are granted for
37 the purpose of assisting the County in financing the acquisition, construction,
38 improvement, or development of the public facilities defined in this Act, including the water
39 and sewer projects or the making of loans for the aforementioned fire or emergency–related
40 equipment, buildings, or other facilities for volunteer fire departments in the County and,
41 to the extent of any such funds received or receivable in any fiscal year, the taxes that are
42 required to be levied may be reduced accordingly.
43 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County is further
44 authorized and empowered, at any time and from time to time, to issue its bonds in the
SENATE BILL 416 5
1 manner herein above described for the purpose of refunding, by payment at maturity or
2 upon purchase or redemption, any bonds issued hereunder. The validity of any such
3 refunding bonds shall in no way be dependent upon or related to the validity or invalidity
4 of the obligations so refunded. The powers herein granted with respect to the issuance of
5 bonds shall be applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be
6 issued by the County for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any of its outstanding
7 bonds issued hereunder at maturity, for the purpose of providing it with funds to purchase
8 in the open market any of its outstanding bonds issued hereunder, prior to the maturity
9 thereof, or for the purpose of providing it with funds for the redemption prior to maturity
10 of any outstanding bonds issued hereunder which are, by their terms, redeemable, for the
11 purpose of providing it with funds to pay interest on any outstanding bonds issued
12 hereunder prior to their payment at maturity of purchase or redemption in advance of
13 maturity, or for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any redemption or purchase
14 premium in connection with the refunding of any of its outstanding bonds issued
15 hereunder. The proceeds of the sale of any such refunding bonds shall be segregated and
16 set apart by the County as a separate trust fund to be used solely for the purpose of paying
17 the purchase or redemption prices of the bonds to be refunded.
18 SECTION 7. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County may, prior to the
19 preparation of definitive bonds, issue interim certificates or temporary bonds, exchangeable
20 for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for such
21 delivery, provided, however, that any such interim certificates or temporary bonds shall be
22 issued in all respects subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Act. The
23 County may, by appropriate resolution, provide for the replacement of any bonds issued
24 hereunder which shall have become mutilated or lost or destroyed upon such conditions
25 and after receiving such indemnity as the County may require.
26 SECTION 8. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any and all obligations issued
27 pursuant to the authority of this Act, their transfer, the interest payable thereon, and any
28 income derived therefrom in the hands of the holders thereof from time to time (including
29 any profit made in the sale thereof) shall be and are hereby declared to be at all times
30 exempt from State, County, municipal, or other taxation of every kind and nature
31 whatsoever within the State of Maryland. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the County
32 from authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable
33 from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
34 SECTION 9. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the authority to borrow
35 money and issue bonds conferred on the County by this Act shall be deemed to provide an
36 additional and alternative authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as
37 supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the County by other laws and shall
38 not be regarded as in derogation of any power now existing; and all Acts of the General
39 Assembly of Maryland heretofore passed authorizing the County to borrow money are
40 hereby continued to the extent that the powers contained in such Acts have not been
41 exercised, and nothing contained in this Act may be construed to impair, in any way, the
42 validity of any bonds that may have been issued by the County under the authority of any
43 said Acts, and the validity of the bonds is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. This
44 Act, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of Carroll County, shall be liberally
6 SENATE BILL 416
1 construed to effect the purposes hereof. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with the
2 provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.

4 June 1, 2025.

22 in the County, as defined and within the limits set forth in this Act.
23 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the bonds hereby authorized
24 shall constitute, and they shall so recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit
25 and unlimited taxing power of the County to the payment of the maturing principal of and
26 interest on the bonds as and when they become payable. In each and every fiscal year that
27 any of the bonds are outstanding, the County shall levy or cause to be levied ad valorem
28 taxes upon all the assessable property within the corporate limits of the County in rate and
29 amount sufficient to provide for or assure the payment, when due, of the principal of and
30 interest on all the bonds maturing in each such fiscal year and, in the event the proceeds
31 from the taxes so levied in any such fiscal year shall prove inadequate for such payment,
32 additional taxes shall be levied in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any such deficiency.
33 The County may apply to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued
34 hereunder any funds received by it as loan repayments from volunteer fire departments
35 and any funds received by it from the State of Maryland, the United States of America, any
36 agency or instrumentality thereof, or from any other source, if such funds are granted for
37 the purpose of assisting the County in financing the acquisition, construction,
38 improvement, or development of the public facilities defined in this Act, including the water
39 and sewer projects or the making of loans for the aforementioned fire or emergency–related
40 equipment, buildings, or other facilities for volunteer fire departments in the County and,
41 to the extent of any such funds received or receivable in any fiscal year, the taxes that are
42 required to be levied may be reduced accordingly.
43 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County is further
44 authorized and empowered, at any time and from time to time, to issue its bonds in the

SENATE BILL 416 5
1 manner herein above described for the purpose of refunding, by payment at maturity or
2 upon purchase or redemption, any bonds issued hereunder. The validity of any such
3 refunding bonds shall in no way be dependent upon or related to the validity or invalidity
4 of the obligations so refunded. The powers herein granted with respect to the issuance of
5 bonds shall be applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be
6 issued by the County for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any of its outstanding
7 bonds issued hereunder at maturity, for the purpose of providing it with funds to purchase
8 in the open market any of its outstanding bonds issued hereunder, prior to the maturity
9 thereof, or for the purpose of providing it with funds for the redemption prior to maturity
10 of any outstanding bonds issued hereunder which are, by their terms, redeemable, for the
11 purpose of providing it with funds to pay interest on any outstanding bonds issued
12 hereunder prior to their payment at maturity of purchase or redemption in advance of
13 maturity, or for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any redemption or purchase
14 premium in connection with the refunding of any of its outstanding bonds issued
15 hereunder. The proceeds of the sale of any such refunding bonds shall be segregated and
16 set apart by the County as a separate trust fund to be used solely for the purpose of paying
17 the purchase or redemption prices of the bonds to be refunded.
18 SECTION 7. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County may, prior to the
19 preparation of definitive bonds, issue interim certificates or temporary bonds, exchangeable
20 for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for such
21 delivery, provided, however, that any such interim certificates or temporary bonds shall be
22 issued in all respects subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Act. The
23 County may, by appropriate resolution, provide for the replacement of any bonds issued
24 hereunder which shall have become mutilated or lost or destroyed upon such conditions
25 and after receiving such indemnity as the County may require.
26 SECTION 8. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any and all obligations issued
27 pursuant to the authority of this Act, their transfer, the interest payable thereon, and any
28 income derived therefrom in the hands of the holders thereof from time to time (including
29 any profit made in the sale thereof) shall be and are hereby declared to be at all times
30 exempt from State, County, municipal, or other taxation of every kind and nature
31 whatsoever within the State of Maryland. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the County
32 from authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable
33 from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
34 SECTION 9. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the authority to borrow
35 money and issue bonds conferred on the County by this Act shall be deemed to provide an
36 additional and alternative authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as
37 supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the County by other laws and shall
38 not be regarded as in derogation of any power now existing; and all Acts of the General
39 Assembly of Maryland heretofore passed authorizing the County to borrow money are
40 hereby continued to the extent that the powers contained in such Acts have not been
41 exercised, and nothing contained in this Act may be construed to impair, in any way, the
42 validity of any bonds that may have been issued by the County under the authority of any
43 said Acts, and the validity of the bonds is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. This
44 Act, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of Carroll County, shall be liberally

6 SENATE BILL 416
1 construed to effect the purposes hereof. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with the
2 provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
3 SECTION 10. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
4 June 1, 2025.
