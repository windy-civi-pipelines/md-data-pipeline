2 HOUSE BILL 557
1 WHEREAS, The Task Force completed its work in 2006, before the Uniform Law
2 Commission approved its first model bill of rights, and therefore the Task Force concluded
3 in its Final Report of December 31, 2006, that it would be prudent to wait on a final proposal
4 for a Maryland Bill of Rights until the model Uniform Law Commission Bill of Rights was
5 made available to the states; and
6 WHEREAS, The Task Force was informally reestablished during 2021 and diligently
7 drafted an updated bill of rights from the Uniform Law Commission, the Montgomery
8 County Commission on Common Ownership Communities, the Maryland Homeowners
9 Association, and other relevant sources; now, therefore,
