Section 1:
2025 Session
HB0951
School Systems - Reportable Offenses - Alterations
This bill generally alters statutory provisions that govern procedures related to “reportable
offenses.” Among other provisions, the bill (1) expands the offenses that qualify as reportable
offenses and (2) requires that a law enforcement agency notify the State’s Attorney when a student
is a suspect in an investigation of an act that, if committed by an adult, would be a felony or crime
of violence, as specified.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
Black students are disproportionately arrested for reportable offenses and also disproportionately
subjected to suspensions and expulsions as compared to their peers. The bill will likely increase
the volume of reportable offenses by adding new offenses and requiring dual-program institutions
of higher education to receive and report under the reportable offenses statute. This may exacerbate
existing disparities evident in reportable offense data reporting, but it is unclear whether increased
reporting will result in increased disparities in school discipline. The bill also requires that law
enforcement officers notify the State’s Attorney of a student who is a suspect in a specified violent
crime, potentially resulting in a notification to school officials at the State’s Attorney’s discretion.
While this requirement would benefit the overall public safety of students, the equity impacts in
these cases would depend heavily on how the bill is implemented. More data regarding the offenses
added to the bill, the number of suspects triggering the bill’s requirements, the length of any school
program disruption as a result of a report, and the portion of students eventually arrested for the
reported offense would be required to measure the actual impacts.
HB 951/ Page 1
Analysis
Generally, the bill makes changes to the educational institutions covered by the reporting
requirements, adds to the offenses for which an arrest triggers notifications, and expands reporting
to include suspected offenders in specified violent crimes.
Under the bill, a “school system” means (1) the schools and school programs under the supervision
of a local superintendent and (2) the institution of higher education or higher education program
in which a student is enrolled as part of a dual enrollment program.
The following offenses are added to the list of reportable offenses in current law:
 sexual offense in the fourth degree;
 child pornography, if the victim does not have knowledge of or does not consent to the
production or the distribution of the child pornography;
 visual surveillance with prurient intent;
 making a threat of mass violence;
 stalking;
 distributing revenge porn; and
 any other act that if committed by an adult would be a felony.
If a student is the suspect in an investigation of an act that if committed by an adult would be a
felony or a crime of violence, the law enforcement agency conducting the investigation must notify
the State’s Attorney within 24 hours of the student being identified as a suspect, as practicable.
The State’s Attorney may notify the local superintendent within 24 hours of the notification, as
practicable. If the law enforcement agency, after providing notice to the State’s Attorney,
determines that the student is no longer a suspect, the law enforcement agency must notify the
State’s Attorney that the student is no longer a suspect within 24 hours of making that
determination. Similarly, if the State’s Attorney has notified the local superintendent of a student’s
identification as a suspect, the State’s Attorney must notify the local superintendent that the student
is no longer a suspect.
If the State’s Attorney determines that school officials have not been notified of a student’s arrest
for a reportable offense (as required under current law), the State’s Attorney may notify the school
officials.
Reportable Offenses
Under existing law, a reportable offense is an offense that (1) occurred off school premises; (2) did
not occur at an event sponsored by the school; and (3) includes a crime of violence, as specified in
current law, and numerous other specified weapons, drug, assault, and theft related offenses. When
a student is arrested for a reportable offense or an offense related to the student’s membership in a
criminal organization, the law enforcement agency making the arrest must notify (1) the local
superintendent; (2) the school principal; and (3) if appropriate, the school security officer. The law
enforcement agency may also notify the State’s Attorney. In 2022, the General Assembly
expressed concern about the purported misuse or overuse of school removals for students arrested
HB 951/ Page 2
for a reportable offense. Chapter 742 of 2022 cla rifies that a “reportable offense” as it relates to
students in public or nonpublic schools is an offense that occurred off school premises and did not
occur at an event sponsored by the school. The Act also requires that students accused of reportable
offenses be disciplined according to existing State regulations and provides for additional due
process accommodations by allowing a student accused of a reportable offense to have an attorney
attend the conference between the student or parent and principal or county superintendent.
Dual Enrollment Programs
The bill broadens the definition of “school system” to include institutions and programs of higher
education where a student is enrolled as part of a dual enrollment program. A “dually enrolled
student” is a student enrolled in both (1) a secondary school in the State and (2) an institution of
higher education in the State. The Maryland Longitudinal Data System Center (MLDS) defines
“dual enrollment” as any program or opportunity that allows high school students to enroll in and
take college courses. This includes programs in which students are enrolled in a dual enrollment
course through a partnership agreement with their local school system and thereby receive both
high school and college credit.
According to MLDS, 23,514 students – approximately 8.25% of all high school students –
participated in dual enrollment programs in Maryland during the 2022-2023 school year.
Impacts of the Bill
Maryland State Department of Education data shows that Black students are overrepresented in
both school disciplinary activity as well as arrests for reportable offenses. Exhibit 1 shows
out-of-school suspensions and expulsions by race and ethnicity for the 2022-2023 school year
compared to each group’s share of the State’s public school enrollment during that year. Black
students make up the largest share of out-of-school suspensions and expulsions at 58% despite
making up only 33% of students.

Local school boards are required to adopt regulati ons designed to maintain an atmosphere of order
and discipline within schools necessary for effective learning. Current law requires that the
primary purpose of any disciplinary measure be rehabilitative, restorative, and educational. State
regulations limit the circumstances under which a student arrested for a reportable offense, which
includes most violent crimes, can be removed from regular school programming to cases in which
the student presents an imminent threat of serious harm to other students or staff.
The bill’s changes to reportable offense notification requirements, covered educational
institutions, and the offenses that must be reported all have the propensity to increase the overall
number of reports under the reportable offense law. Black students would likely be affected to the
greatest extent due to existing disparities in school discipline and arrests for reportable offenses.
Requiring law enforcement to notify the State’s Attorney prior to an arrest for select students is
likely to have the greatest impact on individual students since, in some cases, a student’s regular
educational programming may be disrupted pending a possible arrest. However, it is unclear
whether the increased reporting activity would exacerbate existing disparities in discipline for
students arrested for reportable offenses because a school must follow the same disciplinary
procedures as it does with all other students and removal from regular school programming is
limited to those students that present an imminent danger.
Conclusion
The bill’s addition of offenses under the reportable offenses reporting law will likely increase the
volume of reporting and amplify existing disparities in reportable offense data, particularly for
Black students who already account for a disproportionate number of reportable offense arrests.
Additional offense specific data is not readily available to determine the magnitude of this impact
and the extent to which it results in negative disciplinary outcomes for Black students.
The bill’s expansion of reportable offense reporting to dual-program institutions and additional
notification requirements for students who are suspects in specified violent crimes will likely have
a positive public safety impact since no current mechanism allows law enforcement to notify
school officials of a juvenile attending their school that is a suspect, but who has not been officially
charged. The bill’s overall impacts on racial equity will depend on the extent to which the
discretionary aspects of the bill are carried out by law enforcement, the State’s Attorney, and
school officials.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.

non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
