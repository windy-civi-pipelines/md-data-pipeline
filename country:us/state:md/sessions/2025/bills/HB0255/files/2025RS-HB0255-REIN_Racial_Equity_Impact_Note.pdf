2025 Session
HB0255
No-Knock Warrants
Bill Summary
This bill repeals the authority to issue and execute a no-knock search warrant and alters procedures
for the issuance and execution of a search warrant. The bill (1) establishes that a search warrant
may not authorize a law enforcement officer executing the warrant to enter a building, apartment,
premises, or place to be searched without first announcing the officer’s purpose and authority;
(2) specifies that a search warrant may be executed only between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.; and
(3) requires an officer executing a search warrant to, prior to entering the building, apartment,
premises, or place to be searched under the warrant’s authority, give notice reasonably calculated
to alert any occupants within the location of the officer’s authority and purpose.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
Currently there is not sufficient demographic data available regarding executed no-knock search
warrants that would allow an equity assessment of the bill’s impacts on racial and ethnic groups
in Maryland. Pursuant to Chapter 62 of 2021, the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and
Policy (GOCPP) released its annual report on no-knock warrant service data collected from
Maryland law enforcement agencies in 2023. The report summarized information regarding
no-knock warrant activity by jurisdiction. Both Baltimore and Montgomery counties executed the
most no-knock warrants (14 each) out of a total of 59 around the State. This limited data, however,
is not sufficient to assess if no-knock warrants are disproportionately authorized for individuals of
color. Detailed demographics of the subjects apprehended and others arrested during no-knock
warrants would allow for a more detailed equity analysis of how a ban on these warrants would
affect various racial and ethnic groups in the State.

Analysis
State Data on No-knock Warrants
Chapters 542 and 543 of 2009 required law enforcement agencies that maintain a SWAT team to
report specified information regarding executed no-knock search warrants to GOCPP. The Acts
required general deployment information such as the purpose (search warrant, barricade, arrest
warrant, etc.), date, time, and location of the deployment. These provisions expired on
June 30, 2014.
Chapter 59 of 2021 restored the data collection and reporting of SWAT team activities in which
law enforcement agencies must biannually submit information to GOCPP by January 15 and
July 15 of each year.
Chapter 62 of 2021 enacted comprehensive police reform, including provisions limiting the
grounds for issuing a no-knock warrant. In regard to data collection, Chapter 62 requires a law
enforcement agency to report to GOCPP specified data relating to search warrants executed by the
agency during the prior calendar year. A law enforcement agency must compile the specified data
for each one-year period as a report in a specified format. By September 1 of each year, GOCPP
must (1) submit a report of the analyses and summaries of the submitted information to the
Governor, each law enforcement agency, and the General Assembly and (2) publish the report on
its website. Chapter 62 does not require any data collection regarding the race or ethnicity of the
arrestees, officers, or owners of any property confiscated. Law enforcement agencies must report
the zip code where the warrant was executed.
GOCPP reported that for 2023, a total of 900 SWAT deployments and 59 no-knock search warrants
were executed in Maryland. Exhibit 1 shows the breakdown of the 59 warrants by jurisdiction.
Baltimore and Montgomery counties accounted for 47% of all no-knock search warrants in 2023.

Data and Legislation from Other Jurisdictions
Concerns regarding no-knock warrants focus on various issues, including officer and civilian
safety, mistaken identity, inaccurate information, and insufficient judicial scrutiny. In addition,
there is a growing body of data detailing the disproportionate impacts of the criminal justice system
on people of color, including disparities in arrests and drug sentencing. Several high-profile events
involving no-knock search warrants and the deaths of individuals who were present at the locations
targeted by the warrants suggest that there are disparities in how these warrants are authorized,
executed, and assessed.
The Minneapolis Civil Rights Department’s Office of Police Conduct Review conducted a
preliminary analysis of the Minneapolis Police Department’s service of no-knock search warrants
between September 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022. The office found that 74% of no-knock
warrants were served on Black individuals, who comprised 18% of the city’s population according
to the 2020 census. The office’s investigation was prompted by the fatal shooting of Amir Locke
by Minneapolis police officers serving a search warrant in a downtown apartment building on
February 2, 2022. Locke, a 22-year-old Black man, was not the subject of the search warrant.
Since 2021, at least six states have banned no-knock warrants: Connecticut, Florida, Oregon,
Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. In addition, Maine, Nevada, and Utah have instituted limits
on the availability of no-knock search warrants to law enforcement by requiring that they only be
used in exigent circumstances.
Conclusion
Based on anecdotal evidence from other states and local jurisdictions, the bill’s prohibition on
no-knock search warrants could have a positive impact on Black individuals based on their general
overrepresentation in the criminal justice system. However, there is no way to directly measure
the impacts without demographic data associated with no-knock search targets and arrestees in
previous years and going forward. The GOCPP report summarizing no-knock warrant activity by
jurisdiction, while providing useful information, is not sufficient for an equity assessment of
possible racial or ethnic disparities in the issuance of no-knock search warrants in Maryland.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
