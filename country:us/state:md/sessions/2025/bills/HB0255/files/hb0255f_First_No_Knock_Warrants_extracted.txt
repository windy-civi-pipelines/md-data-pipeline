18 subsection, the order of the court shall be in writing and a copy of the order shall be sent to
19 the State’s Attorney.

23 whom the property was taken to proceed for return of the seized property by petition and
24 an order to show cause to the police authority wrongfully withholding the property; and
25 (ii) it is later ordered that the property be restored to the person from

31 (2) A finding of good cause required by paragraph (1) of this subsection is
32 established by evidence that:
33 (i) the criminal investigation to which the affidavit is related is of a
34 continuing nature and likely to yield further information that could be of use in prosecuting
35 alleged criminal activities; and
8 HOUSE BILL 255
1 (ii) the failure to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation
2 would:
3 1. jeopardize the use of information already obtained in the
4 investigation;

6 3. jeopardize the safety of a source of information.
7 (3) A court may grant one 30–day extension of the time that an affidavit
8 presented in support of a search and seizure warrant is to remain sealed if:
9 (i) law enforcement provides continued evidence as described in
10 paragraph (2) of this subsection; and
11 (ii) the court makes a finding of good cause based on the evidence.
12 (4) After the order sealing the affidavit expires, the affidavit shall be:
13 (i) unsealed; and
14 (ii) delivered within 15 days:
15 1. to the person from whom the property was taken; or
16 2. if that person is not on the premises at the time of delivery,
17 to the person apparently in charge of the premises from which the property was taken.
