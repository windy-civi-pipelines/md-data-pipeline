10 WHEREAS, The State has set aggressive minimum renewable energy requirements,
11 recognizing that a shift toward sustainable energy sources is crucial for the health of our
12 planet and the well–being of future generations; and
13 WHEREAS, The State has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60%
14 from 2006 levels, reflecting a proactive stance in the global effort to combat climate change;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, Distributed solar energy generation is an essential component of
17 meeting these aggressive policies, offering both economic opportunities and environmental
18 benefits; and
19 WHEREAS, The General Assembly finds that an efficient permitting process for
20 distributed solar energy generating stations with consistency across jurisdictions is
21 necessary to meet the State’s renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction
22 commitments and can be structured to preserve farmland and forests; now, therefore,

8 (2020 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
9 Preamble
10 WHEREAS, The State has set aggressive minimum renewable energy requirements,
11 recognizing that a shift toward sustainable energy sources is crucial for the health of our
12 planet and the well–being of future generations; and
13 WHEREAS, The State has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 60%
14 from 2006 levels, reflecting a proactive stance in the global effort to combat climate change;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, Distributed solar energy generation is an essential component of
17 meeting these aggressive policies, offering both economic opportunities and environmental
18 benefits; and
19 WHEREAS, The General Assembly finds that an efficient permitting process for
20 distributed solar energy generating stations with consistency across jurisdictions is
21 necessary to meet the State’s renewable energy and greenhouse gas reduction
22 commitments and can be structured to preserve farmland and forests; now, therefore,
