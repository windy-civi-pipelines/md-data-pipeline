HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION
1 A House Joint Resolution concerning
2 Use of Nuclear Weapons
3 FOR the purpose of stating that the General Assembly joins certain other state legislative
4 bodies, counties, and municipalities in passing a Back from the Brink resolution on
5 reducing the possibility of the use of nuclear weapons; urging members of the State’s
6 Congressional Delegation to cosponsor a certain federal resolution related to the use
7 of nuclear weapons; and urging the U.S. President and the U.S. Senate to endorse
8 the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.
9 WHEREAS, Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons ever created by
10 mankind; and
11 WHEREAS, 90% of nuclear weapons are controlled by the U.S. and Russia, with the
12 rest being controlled by seven other countries: China, France, Israel, India, North Korea,
13 Pakistan, and the United Kingdom; and
14 WHEREAS, The use of even a small fraction of nuclear weapons, such as 100
15 Hiroshima–sized bombs, which are small bombs by modern standards, could put at least
16 5.5 million tons of soot into the atmosphere and cause climate disruption across the planet,
17 cutting food production and putting 250 million people at risk of starvation; and
18 WHEREAS, A large–scale nuclear war would kill hundreds of millions of people
19 directly, risk starvation for 5 billion people worldwide including in the U.S., and cause
20 unimaginable environmental damage and catastrophic climate disruption by dropping
21 temperatures across the planet to levels not seen since the Ice Age, causing the vast
22 majority of the human race to starve and possibly cause humans to become extinct as a
23 species; and

2 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 6
1 WHEREAS, The U.S. and Russia rely on the assurances of deterrence, that nuclear
2 arsenals are never used, and yet there have been many close calls due to human or
3 mechanical error; and
4 WHEREAS, The U.S. President has the authority to unilaterally initiate the use of
5 nuclear weapons, and during times of crisis, individuals lower in the chain of command
6 might mistakenly do so; and
7 WHEREAS, The U.S. maintains nuclear missiles on hair–trigger alert, making them
8 capable of being launched within minutes and greatly increasing the risk of an unintended
9 or unauthorized launch, especially in current times when tensions are mounting between
10 nuclear powers and the U.S. maintains the right to initiate a nuclear launch; and
11 WHEREAS, The ongoing expenditure of $1.7 trillion over 30 years to enhance the
12 U.S. nuclear arsenal is fueling a global arms race; and
13 WHEREAS, Despite the incredible expenditure on nuclear weapons, one in six
14 military families are food insecure; and
15 WHEREAS, Marylanders paid an estimated $2.1 billion in taxes in fiscal year 2024
16 for the nuclear weapons complex; and
17 WHEREAS, Living in the shadow of Washington, D.C., Marylanders are especially
18 at risk if there is nuclear war, making it appropriate that the General Assembly of
19 Maryland urge the federal government to do everything possible to reduce the risk of
20 nuclear war starting by error or by intent; and
21 WHEREAS, Two major conflicts in 2024 involving nations that possess nuclear
22 weapons make multilateral negotiations between nuclear nations more important now than
23 ever; and
24 WHEREAS, In July 2017, the United Nations adopted the Treaty on the Prohibition
25 of Nuclear Weapons which makes it illegal for ratifying nations to develop, test, produce,
26 manufacture or otherwise acquire, possess or stockpile, transfer, use, or threaten the use
27 of nuclear weapons; and
28 WHEREAS, As of September 24, 2024, 73 nations have ratified or acceded to the
29 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons; and
30 WHEREAS, House Resolution 77 introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives
31 in the 118th Congress embraced the goals and provisions of the Treaty on the Prohibition
32 of Nuclear Weapons, as well as the five policies of Back from the Brink to: (1) actively
33 pursue a multilateral verifiable agreement among nuclear armed states to eliminate their
34 nuclear arsenals; (2) renounce the option of using nuclear weapons first; (3) end the
35 President’s sole authority to launch a nuclear attack; (4) take nuclear weapons off
36 hair–trigger alert; and (5) cancel current plans to replace or modernize its nuclear arsenal;
37 now, therefore, be it
