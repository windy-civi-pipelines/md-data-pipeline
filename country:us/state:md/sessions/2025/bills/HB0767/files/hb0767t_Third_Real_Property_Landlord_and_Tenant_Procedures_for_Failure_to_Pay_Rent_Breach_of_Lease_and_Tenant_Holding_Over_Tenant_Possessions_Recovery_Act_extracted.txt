2 HOUSE BILL 767
1 Annotated Code of Maryland
2 (2023 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
3 Preamble
4 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity
5 to reclaim their personal belongings after an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
6 and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal
9 belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and
10 WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings
11 safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community; now, therefore,
12 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
13 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
14 Article – Real Property
15 8–401.

17 SUBTITLE AND SUBJECT to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if judgment
18 is given in favor of the landlord, and the tenant fails to comply with the requirements of
19 the order within 7 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 7 days, issue
20 its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the
21 official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the
22 landlord, or the landlord’s duly qualified agent or attorney, in possession of the property[,
23 and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, all the furniture,
24 implements, tools, goods, effects or other chattels of every description whatsoever belonging
25 to the tenant, or to any person claiming or holding by or under the tenant].
26 (ii) If the landlord does not order a warrant of restitution within 60
27 days from the later of the date of judgment or the expiration date of any stay of execution:
28 1. The judgment for possession shall be stricken; and
29 2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
30 necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established
31 in subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section unless the court in its discretion determines that
32 the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section.
HOUSE BILL 767 3
1 (iii) If the landlord orders a warrant of restitution but takes no action
2 on the warrant within 60 days from the later of the date the court issues the order for the

5 for possession shall be stricken; and
6 2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
7 necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established

22 execution of the warrant of restitution for which the stay has been granted shall be given
23 priority and completed within 5 days after the extreme weather conditions cease.

25 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
26 [(g)] (H) (1) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, in any action of
27 summary ejectment for failure to pay rent where the landlord is awarded a judgment giving

29 redemption of the leased premises by tendering in cash, certified check, or money order to
30 the landlord or the landlord’s agent all past due amounts, as determined by the court under
31 subsection (e) of this section, plus all court awarded costs and fees, at any time before actual
32 execution of the eviction order.
33 (2) An electronic or written check issued by a political subdivision or on

4 HOUSE BILL 767
1 (3) This subsection does not apply to any tenant against whom three
2 judgments of possession have been entered for rent due and unpaid in the 12 months prior

5 District Court to the circuit court for any county at any time within 4 days from the
6 rendition of the judgment.
7 (2) The tenant, in order to stay any execution of the judgment, shall give a
8 bond to the landlord with one or more sureties, who are owners of sufficient property in the
9 State of Maryland, with condition to prosecute the appeal with effect, and answer to the
10 landlord in all costs and damages mentioned in the judgment, and other damages as shall
11 be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
12 (3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to
13 proceed against the tenant, assignee or subtenant for any and all rents that may become
14 due and payable to the landlord after the rendition of the judgment.
15 8–402.
16 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for
17 any definite term or at will, and the landlord shall desire to repossess the property after
18 the expiration of the term for which it was leased and shall give notice as required under
19 subsection (c) of this section to the tenant or to the person actually in possession of the
20 property to remove from the property at the end of the term, and if the tenant or person in
21 actual possession shall refuse to comply, the landlord may make complaint in writing to
22 the District Court of the county where the property is located.
23 (ii) 1. The court shall issue a summons directed to any constable

32 property.
33 4. After notice to the tenant, assignee, or subtenant by
34 first–class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed
35 to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
36 (iii) [Upon] ON the failure of either of the parties to appear before
37 the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not
HOUSE BILL 767 5
1 less than 6 [nor] DAYS OR more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the
2 parties of the continuance.
3 (2) (i) If [upon] ON hearing the parties, or in case the tenant or person
4 in possession shall neglect to appear after the summons and continuance the court shall
5 find that the landlord had been in possession of the leased property, that the said tenancy
6 is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant
7 or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,
8 the court shall [thereupon] give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said
9 premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective
10 counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord
11 possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same
12 at the time when the tenancy was made, and shall give judgment for costs against the
13 tenant or person in possession so holding over.
14 (ii) Either party shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the
15 circuit court for the county within 10 days from the judgment.
16 (iii) If the tenant appeals and files with the District Court an affidavit

18 securities conditioned that the tenant will prosecute the appeal with effect and well and
19 truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the
20 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
21 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall
22 so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
23 thereof until the determination of said appeal.
24 (iv) The appellate court shall, [upon] ON application of either party,
25 set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days
26 after the application, and notice for the order for a hearing shall be served on the opposite
27 party or that party’s counsel at least 5 days before the hearing.
28 (v) If the judgment of the District Court shall be in favor of the
29 landlord, a warrant shall be issued by the appellate court to the sheriff, who shall proceed
30 forthwith to execute the warrant.

32 SUBSECTION SHALL BE EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF §
33 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
34 8–402.1.
35 (a) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where an unexpired lease
36 for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the
37 expiration of the stated term if the tenant breaches the lease, the landlord may make
38 complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the premises is located if:
6 HOUSE BILL 767
1 1. The tenant breaches the lease;
2 2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written
3 notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the
4 leased premises; or
5 B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a
6 person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
7 imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
8 the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property
9 and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that
10 the tenant or person in possession is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to
11 repossess the leased premises; and
12 3. The tenant or person in actual possession of the premises
13 refuses to comply.
14 (ii) The court shall summons immediately the tenant or person in

16 why restitution of the possession of the leased premises should not be made to the landlord.
17 (2) (i) If, for any reason, the tenant or person in actual possession
18 cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons
19 conspicuously on the property.
20 (ii) After notice is sent to the tenant or person in possession by
21 first–class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed
22 to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
23 (3) If either of the parties fails to appear before the court on the day stated
24 in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
25 more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
26 (b) (1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease
27 and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give
28 judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the
29 sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full
30 and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
31 was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
32 possession.

9 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
10 [(c)] (D) (1) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall
11 not operate as a waiver of any notice of breach of lease or any judgment for possession
12 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
13 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
14 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of
15 the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then
16 to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.
17 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
18 paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant
19 in the same manner as security deposits as defined under § 8–203 of this title but shall not
20 be subject to the penalties of that section.

2 HOUSE BILL 767
1 Annotated Code of Maryland
2 (2023 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
3 Preamble
4 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity
5 to reclaim their personal belongings after an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
6 and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
7 and
8 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal
9 belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and
10 WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings
11 safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community; now, therefore,
12 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
13 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
14 Article – Real Property
15 8–401.
16 (f) (1) (i) [Subject] EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN § 8–407 OF THIS
17 SUBTITLE AND SUBJECT to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, if judgment
18 is given in favor of the landlord, and the tenant fails to comply with the requirements of
19 the order within 7 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 7 days, issue
20 its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the
21 official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the
22 landlord, or the landlord’s duly qualified agent or attorney, in possession of the property[,
23 and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, all the furniture,
24 implements, tools, goods, effects or other chattels of every description whatsoever belonging
25 to the tenant, or to any person claiming or holding by or under the tenant].
26 (ii) If the landlord does not order a warrant of restitution within 60
27 days from the later of the date of judgment or the expiration date of any stay of execution:
28 1. The judgment for possession shall be stricken; and
29 2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
30 necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established
31 in subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section unless the court in its discretion determines that
32 the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section.

HOUSE BILL 767 3
1 (iii) If the landlord orders a warrant of restitution but takes no action
2 on the warrant within 60 days from the later of the date the court issues the order for the
3 warrant or the date as otherwise extended by the court:
4 1. The warrant of restitution shall expire and the judgment
5 for possession shall be stricken; and
6 2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
7 necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established
8 in subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section unless the court in its discretion determines that
9 the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section.
10 (2) (i) The administrative judge of any district shall stay the execution
11 of a warrant of restitution of a residential property, from day to day, in the event of extreme
12 weather conditions affecting the residential property, including:
13 1. A temperature or next–day forecasted temperature of 32
14 degrees Fahrenheit or lower;
15 2. A winter storm warning or blizzard warning issued by the
16 National Weather Service;
17 3. A hurricane warning or tropical storm warning issued by
18 the National Weather Service; and
19 4. An excessive heat warning issued by the National
20 Weather Service.
21 (ii) When a stay has been granted under this paragraph, the
22 execution of the warrant of restitution for which the stay has been granted shall be given
23 priority and completed within 5 days after the extreme weather conditions cease.
24 (G) A WARRANT OF RESTITUTION ISSUED UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE
25 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
26 [(g)] (H) (1) Subject to paragraph (3) of this subsection, in any action of
27 summary ejectment for failure to pay rent where the landlord is awarded a judgment giving
28 the landlord restitution of the leased premises, the tenant shall have the right to
29 redemption of the leased premises by tendering in cash, certified check, or money order to
30 the landlord or the landlord’s agent all past due amounts, as determined by the court under
31 subsection (e) of this section, plus all court awarded costs and fees, at any time before actual
32 execution of the eviction order.
33 (2) An electronic or written check issued by a political subdivision or on
34 behalf of a governmental entity shall have the same legal effect as a payment made by the
35 tenant under paragraph (1) of this subsection.

4 HOUSE BILL 767
1 (3) This subsection does not apply to any tenant against whom three
2 judgments of possession have been entered for rent due and unpaid in the 12 months prior
3 to the initiation of the action to which this subsection otherwise would apply.
4 [(h)] (I) (1) The tenant or the landlord may appeal from the judgment of the
5 District Court to the circuit court for any county at any time within 4 days from the
6 rendition of the judgment.
7 (2) The tenant, in order to stay any execution of the judgment, shall give a
8 bond to the landlord with one or more sureties, who are owners of sufficient property in the
9 State of Maryland, with condition to prosecute the appeal with effect, and answer to the
10 landlord in all costs and damages mentioned in the judgment, and other damages as shall
11 be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
12 (3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to
13 proceed against the tenant, assignee or subtenant for any and all rents that may become
14 due and payable to the landlord after the rendition of the judgment.
15 8–402.
16 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for
17 any definite term or at will, and the landlord shall desire to repossess the property after
18 the expiration of the term for which it was leased and shall give notice as required under
19 subsection (c) of this section to the tenant or to the person actually in possession of the
20 property to remove from the property at the end of the term, and if the tenant or person in
21 actual possession shall refuse to comply, the landlord may make complaint in writing to
22 the District Court of the county where the property is located.
23 (ii) 1. The court shall issue a summons directed to any constable
24 or sheriff of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the constable or sheriff to notify
25 the tenant, assignee, or subtenant to appear on a day stated in the summons before the
26 court to show cause why restitution should not be made to the landlord.
27 2. The constable or sheriff shall serve the summons on the
28 tenant, assignee, or subtenant on the property, or on the known or authorized agent of the
29 tenant, assignee, or subtenant.
30 3. If, for any reason those persons cannot be found, the
31 constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously on the
32 property.
33 4. After notice to the tenant, assignee, or subtenant by
34 first–class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed
35 to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
36 (iii) [Upon] ON the failure of either of the parties to appear before
37 the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not

HOUSE BILL 767 5
1 less than 6 [nor] DAYS OR more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the
2 parties of the continuance.
3 (2) (i) If [upon] ON hearing the parties, or in case the tenant or person
4 in possession shall neglect to appear after the summons and continuance the court shall
5 find that the landlord had been in possession of the leased property, that the said tenancy
6 is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant
7 or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,
8 the court shall [thereupon] give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said
9 premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective
10 counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord
11 possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same
12 at the time when the tenancy was made, and shall give judgment for costs against the
13 tenant or person in possession so holding over.
14 (ii) Either party shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the
15 circuit court for the county within 10 days from the judgment.
16 (iii) If the tenant appeals and files with the District Court an affidavit
17 that the appeal is not taken for delay, and also a good and sufficient bond with one or more
18 securities conditioned that the tenant will prosecute the appeal with effect and well and
19 truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the
20 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
21 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall
22 so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
23 thereof until the determination of said appeal.
24 (iv) The appellate court shall, [upon] ON application of either party,
25 set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days
26 after the application, and notice for the order for a hearing shall be served on the opposite
27 party or that party’s counsel at least 5 days before the hearing.
28 (v) If the judgment of the District Court shall be in favor of the
29 landlord, a warrant shall be issued by the appellate court to the sheriff, who shall proceed
30 forthwith to execute the warrant.
31 (3) A WARRANT OF RESTITUTION UNDER PARAGRAPH (2)(I) OF THIS
32 SUBSECTION SHALL BE EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF §
33 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
34 8–402.1.
35 (a) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where an unexpired lease
36 for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the
37 expiration of the stated term if the tenant breaches the lease, the landlord may make
38 complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the premises is located if:

6 HOUSE BILL 767
1 1. The tenant breaches the lease;
2 2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written
3 notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the
4 leased premises; or
5 B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a
6 person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
7 imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
8 the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property
9 and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that
10 the tenant or person in possession is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to
11 repossess the leased premises; and
12 3. The tenant or person in actual possession of the premises
13 refuses to comply.
14 (ii) The court shall summons immediately the tenant or person in
15 possession to appear before the court on a day stated in the summons to show cause, if any,
16 why restitution of the possession of the leased premises should not be made to the landlord.
17 (2) (i) If, for any reason, the tenant or person in actual possession
18 cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons
19 conspicuously on the property.
20 (ii) After notice is sent to the tenant or person in possession by
21 first–class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed
22 to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
23 (3) If either of the parties fails to appear before the court on the day stated
24 in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
25 more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
26 (b) (1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease
27 and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give
28 judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the
29 sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full
30 and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
31 was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
32 possession.
33 (2) Either party may appeal to the circuit court for the county, within [ten]
34 10 days from entry of the judgment. If the tenant (i) files with the District Court an affidavit
35 that the appeal is not taken for delay; (ii) files sufficient bond with one or more securities
36 conditioned [upon] ON diligent prosecution of the appeal; (iii) pays all rent in arrears, all
37 court costs in the case; and (iv) pays all losses or damages which the landlord may suffer

HOUSE BILL 767 7

3 either party, the court shall set a day for the hearing of the appeal not less than [five nor]
4 5 DAYS OR more than 15 days after the application, and notice of the order for a hearing
5 shall be served on the other party or that party’s counsel at least [five] 5 days before the
6 hearing. If the judgment of the District Court is in favor of the landlord, a warrant shall be
7 issued by the court which hears the appeal to the sheriff, who shall execute the warrant.
8 (C) A WARRANT OF RESTITUTION ISSUED UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE
9 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
10 [(c)] (D) (1) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall
11 not operate as a waiver of any notice of breach of lease or any judgment for possession
12 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
13 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
14 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of
15 the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then
16 to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.
17 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
18 paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant
19 in the same manner as security deposits as defined under § 8–203 of this title but shall not
20 be subject to the penalties of that section.
21 8–407.
