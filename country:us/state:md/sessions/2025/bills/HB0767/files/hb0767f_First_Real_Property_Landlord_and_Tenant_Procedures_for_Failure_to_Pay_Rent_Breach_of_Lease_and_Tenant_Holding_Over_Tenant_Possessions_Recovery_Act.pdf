5 be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
6 (3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to

9 8–402.
10 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for

31 the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not
32 less than 6 [nor] DAYS OR more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the

34 (2) (i) If [upon] ON hearing the parties, or in case the tenant or person
35 in possession shall neglect to appear after the summons and continuance the court shall
36 find that the landlord had been in possession of the leased property, that the said tenancy
37 is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant
38 or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,

HOUSE BILL 767 5
1 the court shall [thereupon] give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said
2 premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective
3 counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord
4 possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same
5 at the time when the tenancy was made, and shall give judgment for costs against the
6 tenant or person in possession so holding over.
7 (ii) Either party shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the
8 circuit court for the county within 10 days from the judgment.

11 securities conditioned that the tenant will prosecute the appeal with effect and well and
12 truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the
13 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
14 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall
15 so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
16 thereof until the determination of said appeal.
17 (iv) The appellate court shall, [upon] ON application of either party,
18 set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days
19 after the application, and notice for the order for a hearing shall be served on the opposite
20 party or that party’s counsel at least 5 days before the hearing.
21 (v) If the judgment of the District Court shall be in favor of the
22 landlord, a warrant shall be issued by the appellate court to the sheriff, who shall proceed

27 8–402.1.
28 (a) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where an unexpired lease
29 for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the
30 expiration of the stated term if the tenant breaches the lease, the landlord may make
31 complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the premises is located if:
32 1. The tenant breaches the lease;
33 2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written
34 notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the
35 leased premises; or

6 HOUSE BILL 767
1 B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a
2 person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
3 imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
4 the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property
5 and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that
6 the tenant or person in possession is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to
7 repossess the leased premises; and
8 3. The tenant or person in actual possession of the premises
9 refuses to comply.
10 (ii) The court shall summons immediately the tenant or person in
11 possession to appear before the court on a day stated in the summons to show cause, if any,
12 why restitution of the possession of the leased premises should not be made to the landlord.
13 (2) (i) If, for any reason, the tenant or person in actual possession
14 cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons
15 conspicuously on the property.
16 (ii) After notice is sent to the tenant or person in possession by
17 first–class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed
18 to be a sufficient service to support restitution.
19 (3) If either of the parties fails to appear before the court on the day stated
20 in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
21 more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
22 (b) (1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease
23 and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give
24 judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the
25 sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full
26 and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
27 was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
28 possession.
29 (2) Either party may appeal to the circuit court for the county, within [ten]
30 10 days from entry of the judgment. If the tenant (i) files with the District Court an affidavit
31 that the appeal is not taken for delay; (ii) files sufficient bond with one or more securities
32 conditioned [upon] ON diligent prosecution of the appeal; (iii) pays all rent in arrears, all
33 court costs in the case; and (iv) pays all losses or damages which the landlord may suffer
34 by reason of the tenant’s holding over, the tenant or person in possession of the premises
35 may retain possession until the determination of the appeal. [Upon] ON application of
36 either party, the court shall set a day for the hearing of the appeal not less than [five nor]
37 5 DAYS OR more than 15 days after the application, and notice of the order for a hearing
38 shall be served on the other party or that party’s counsel at least [five] 5 days before the

HOUSE BILL 767 7

2 issued by the court which hears the appeal to the sheriff, who shall execute the warrant.
3 (C) A WARRANT OF RESTITUTION ISSUED UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL BE
4 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
5 [(c)] (D) (1) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall
6 not operate as a waiver of any notice of breach of lease or any judgment for possession
7 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
8 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
9 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of
10 the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then
11 to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.
12 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
13 paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant
14 in the same manner as security deposits as defined under § 8–203 of this title but shall not
15 be subject to the penalties of that section.
