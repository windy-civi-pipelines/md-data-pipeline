Preamble
WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity
to reclaim their personal belongings after of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
and
WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal
belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and
WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings
safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community; now, therefore,

(House Bill 767)
AN ACT concerning
Real Property – Landlord and Tenant – Procedures for Failure to Pay Rent,
Breach of Lease, and Tenant Holding Over
(Tenant Possessions Recovery Act)
FOR the purpose of requiring a landlord to provide certain notice to a tenant when a court
has issued a warrant of restitution for a failure of a tenant to pay rent, a breach of
lease, or a tenant holding over under certain circumstances; establishing certain
procedures and requirements for the execution of a warrant for repossession;
providing for the disposition of certain personal property following the execution of
a warrant of restitution; establishing that this Act does not restrict the authority of
the State or a local jurisdiction to enact certain legislation; and generally relating to
repossession for failure to pay rent, breach of lease, and tenant holdovers.
BY repealing and reenacting, with amendments,
Article – Real Property
Section 8–401(f), (g), and (h), 8–402(b), and 8–402.1
Annotated Code of Maryland
(2023 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
BY adding to
Article – Real Property
Section 8–401(g) and 8–407
Annotated Code of Maryland
(2023 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
Preamble
WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity
to reclaim their personal belongings after of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
and
WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal
belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and
WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings
safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community; now, therefore,
SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
– 1 –

Ch. 563 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND

the order within 7 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 7 days, issue
its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the
official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the
landlord, or the landlord’s duly qualified agent or attorney, in possession of the property[,
and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, all the furniture,
implements, tools, goods, effects or other chattels of every description whatsoever belonging

days from the later of the date of judgment or the expiration date of any stay of execution:
1. The judgment for possession shall be stricken; and
2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established

the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section.
(iii) If the landlord orders a warrant of restitution but takes no action
on the warrant within 60 days from the later of the date the court issues the order for the
warrant or the date as otherwise extended by the court:

for possession shall be stricken; and
2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established

the landlord or the landlord’s agent all past due amounts, as determined by the court under
subsection (e) of this section, plus all court awarded costs and fees, at any time before actual

(2) The tenant, in order to stay any execution of the judgment, shall give a

State of Maryland, with condition to prosecute the appeal with effect, and answer to the
landlord in all costs and damages mentioned in the judgment, and other damages as shall
be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
(3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to

or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,

premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective
counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord
possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same

truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the
appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the

so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
thereof until the determination of said appeal.
(iv) The appellate court shall, [upon] ON application of either party,
set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days

for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the

complaint in writing to the District Court of the county where the premises is located if:

2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written
notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the
leased premises; or
B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a
person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property

(2) (i) If, for any reason, the tenant or person in actual possession
cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons

in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
(b) (1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease
and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give

and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
possession.

conditioned [upon] ON diligent prosecution of the appeal; (iii) pays all rent in arrears, all
court costs in the case; and (iv) pays all losses or damages which the landlord may suffer

may retain possession until the determination of the appeal. [Upon] ON application of
either party, the court shall set a day for the hearing of the appeal not less than [five nor]
5 DAYS OR more than 15 days after the application, and notice of the order for a hearing
