10 (2023 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
11 Preamble
12 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity
13 to reclaim their personal belongings after of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
14 and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
15 and
16 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal
17 belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and
18 WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings
19 safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community; now, therefore,
20 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
21 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
22 Article – Real Property
23 8–401.

27 the order within 7 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 7 days, issue
28 its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the
29 official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the
30 landlord, or the landlord’s duly qualified agent or attorney, in possession of the property[,
31 and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, all the furniture,
32 implements, tools, goods, effects or other chattels of every description whatsoever belonging
33 to the tenant, or to any person claiming or holding by or under the tenant].

10 for possession shall be stricken; and
11 2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments

18 be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
19 (3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to

23 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for

9 less than 6 [nor] DAYS OR more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the

14 is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant
15 or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,
16 the court shall [thereupon] give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said
17 premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective
18 counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord
19 possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same

28 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
29 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall
30 so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
31 thereof until the determination of said appeal.

33 set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days

5 (a) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where an unexpired lease
6 for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the

14 person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
15 imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
16 the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property
17 and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that

26 cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons
27 conspicuously on the property.

32 in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
33 more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.

35 and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give

HOUSE BILL 767 7
1 judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the
2 sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full
3 and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
4 was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
5 possession.

9 conditioned [upon] ON diligent prosecution of the appeal; (iii) pays all rent in arrears, all
10 court costs in the case; and (iv) pays all losses or damages which the landlord may suffer

13 either party, the court shall set a day for the hearing of the appeal not less than [five nor]
14 5 DAYS OR more than 15 days after the application, and notice of the order for a hearing

19 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.
20 [(c)] (D) (1) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall
21 not operate as a waiver of any notice of breach of lease or any judgment for possession
22 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
23 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
24 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of
25 the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then
26 to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.
27 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
28 paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant

30 be subject to the penalties of that section.
