7 WHEREAS, The orange crush cocktail originated in 1995 at the Harborside Bar and
8 Grill in Ocean City, Maryland; and
9 WHEREAS, Chromite was first discovered in the United States by Isaac Tyson, Jr.,
10 in Bare Hills, Baltimore County in 1808; and
11 WHEREAS, This ore of the important metal chromium appeared as heavy black sand
12 in the streams and gullies of Maryland’s serpentine barrens, or as heavy dark rocks found
13 on the surface; and
14 WHEREAS, Later discoveries of the mineral were found in the serpentine barrens
15 of Harford County, Cecil County, Soldier’s Delight of Baltimore County, and southeastern
16 Pennsylvania; and
17 WHEREAS, Until the 1850s, this region provided most of the world’s chromite, as
18 Isaac Tyson, Jr., exported the valuable mineral via Baltimore Clipper ships from Fells Point
19 in Baltimore; and
20 WHEREAS, Isaac Tyson, Jr., established the Baltimore Chrome Works, the nation’s
21 first chromium chemicals plant in the United States, dominated the chrome industry,
22 started the renowned Tyson Mining Company, and was inducted into the National Mining
23 Hall of Fame and Museum in 1996; and
24 WHEREAS, Chromite is found in Baltimore, Carroll, Cecil, Harford, Howard, and
25 Montgomery counties and its historical relevance is reflected in the naming of local interest
26 points, such as Chrome Hill in Harford County, Chromine Road in Baltimore County, and
27 Chrome Mine Road in Montgomery County; and
28 WHEREAS, Chromite reflects the nature of Maryland’s rich mining history and vast
29 mineral resources; now, therefore,
