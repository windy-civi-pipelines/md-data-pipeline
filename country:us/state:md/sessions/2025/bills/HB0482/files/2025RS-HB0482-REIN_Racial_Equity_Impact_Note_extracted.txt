HB0482
Predetermination Review Process
Bill Summary
This bill establishes a predetermination review process under which an individual can request that
certain State agencies review the individual’s criminal history to determine whether that criminal
history would disqualify the individual from obtaining an occupational license or certification
being sought from the agency.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill adds provisions to the professional licensure and certification process that would reduce
impediments for individuals with previous convictions or other contacts with the criminal justice
system when those individuals apply for occupational licensing and certification. These provisions
potentially benefit Black applicants who were previously incarcerated to the greatest extent. There
is no data currently available to estimate the extent of the impacts. The magnitude of the bill’s
impact on applicants with a criminal history would depend on the level of increased applicant
activity and implementation by the applicable departments.
Analysis
In furtherance of existing State policy to encourage the employment of nonviolent ex-offenders
and remove barriers to their ability to demonstrate fitness for occupational licenses or
certifications, the bill establishes a predetermination process for applicants. This process allows
ex-offenders to request specified agencies to review their criminal record and make a preliminary
determination as to whether the applicant would be approved or denied a license or certification.
The agency must advise any applicant that would be denied of any potential ways to remedy the
HB 482/ Page 1
reason(s) for disqualification. Any applicant previ ously denied under the predetermination process
may reapply either one year later or upon completion of any remedial actions recommended by the
agency. The bill also allows an agency to charge a criminal history review fee of up to $100 but
includes provisions to waive the fee if the applicant meets specified income requirements. The bill
also repeals the blanket prohibition on sex offenders from receiving licenses and certification from
the agencies covered under the bill and removes the Department of Public Safety and Correctional
Services (DPSCS) from its requirements.
The bill applies to all units of the Maryland Department of Agriculture; the Maryland Department
of the Environment; the Maryland Department of Health (MDH); the Department of Human
Services; and the Maryland Department of Labor (MD Labor). These agencies issue an array of
occupational and professional licenses across a wide spectrum of industries, from home
improvement contractors to nurses to well drillers. Under existing law, with the exception of
individuals previously convicted of crimes of violence or sex offenses for which registration on
the sex offender registry is required, agencies cannot deny applications for licenses and
certifications solely on the basis of a prior conviction. An exception to this general rule is if (1)
the agency determines that there is a direct relationship between the previous conviction and the
specific license or certification sought or (2) issuance would involve an unreasonable risk to
property or to the safety of specific individuals or the general public. Despite the aforementioned
exceptions, ex-offenders who have not reoffended in the previous seven years may not be denied
an occupational license or certification solely on the basis of a previous conviction.
Groups Affected by the Bill
The bill impacts individuals with previous criminal records, including both those who were not
sentenced to incarceration and those who were previously incarcerated and are in various stages
of reentry into society. Updated statistics from DPSCS show that in fiscal 2023, 3,355 inmates
were released from incarceration on parole and 3,276 were released on probation. Another nearly
24,000 individuals were never incarcerated but instead placed on probation after a conviction and
sentencing. Black ex-offenders are significantly overrepresented in the post-incarceration
population, accounting for 59% of the population under supervision by the Division of Parole and
Probation in fiscal 2023.
Nature of the Impact
A significant challenge for individuals post-sentence and post-incarceration is securing
employment. Previous research has detailed the collateral consequences to having a criminal
record that often exacerbate the challenges of social reintegration following imprisonment. Even
individuals convicted of criminal charges that do not face imprisonment may still see significant
adverse effects as a result of having a criminal record. These adverse effects include reduced access
to housing, public services, voting, holding public office, employment opportunities, and
professional licensure. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that roughly 25% of civilian
workers in 2022 had employment which required professional certification or licensure.
Accordingly, those denied these licenses and certification due to the disclosure of their criminal
history may face significant barriers to factors that aid in successful social reentry and deter against
recidivism. Existing patterns of racial disparity and disproportionality in the State’s inmate
population indicate the bill may have a positive impact on those who were previously incarcerated.
HB 482/ Page 2
In particular, Black individuals would likely b e impacted to the greatest extent given their
overrepresentation in the State’s incarcerated population.
Licensing and Certification Data Regarding Individuals with Criminal Records
Data on the applicant pools for licensing and certification is limited. Chapter 796 of 2018 required
the departments covered under this bill to report to the Governor and the General Assembly
information related to the denial of licenses or certificates for the preceding five years based on an
applicant’s criminal history. While some of the departments covered under Chapter 796 reported
little to no data, MD Labor and MDH reported that less than 1% of the applicants for various
licenses were individuals with criminal histories.
Conclusion
The bill’s provisions expanding potential eligibility for certain ex-offenders, establishing a
predetermination of eligibility process, and providing an opportunity for applicants to take
remedial actions to obtain eligibility will likely increase the number of successful applicants for
licenses and certifications covered by the bill. Black individuals could likely benefit the most from
the bill due to their overrepresentation in the ex-offender population. To the extent that these
individuals successfully apply for occupational licenses and/or certification, the bill would
increase the likelihood of successful reentry into the general population. There is no way to reliably
measure the impact of the bill without demographic data for applicants to the agencies covered by
the bill and prospective data on those individuals who would be newly eligible to apply for
licensure and certification under the bill.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
