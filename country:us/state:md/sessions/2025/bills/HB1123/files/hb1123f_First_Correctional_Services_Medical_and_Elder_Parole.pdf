22 specified in § 7–301 of this subtitle.

8 condition, including the family home of the parolee, as specified by the Commission or the
9 supervising agent; and
10 (2) the parolee forward authentic copies of applicable medical records to
11 indicate that the particular medical condition giving rise to the release continues to exist.
12 (g) (1) If the Commission has reason to believe that a parolee is no longer so
13 debilitated or incapacitated as to be physically incapable of presenting a danger to society,
14 the parolee shall be returned to the custody of the Division of Correction or the local
15 correctional facility from which the incarcerated individual was released.
16 (2) (i) A parole hearing for a parolee returned to custody shall be held
17 to consider whether the parolee remains incapacitated and shall be heard promptly.

22 requirements specified in § 7–301 of this subtitle.
