2025 Session
HB1433
Juvenile Court - Jurisdiction
Bill Summary
This bill expands the jurisdiction of the juvenile court by repealing and altering existing statutory
exceptions to the juvenile court’s exclusive original jurisdiction. The bill applies only
prospectively and does not apply to any criminal prosecution or delinquency proceeding for any
act committed before the bill’s October 1, 2025 effective date.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill would substantially reduce the number of cases heard in the circuit court involving
juveniles charged as adults. This would significantly reduce the likelihood of harsher punitive
outcomes and provide restorative and rehabilitative services to all youth charged as adults as
specified in the bill. Youth of color will be positively impacted to a much greater extent due to
their large overrepresentation in the group of youth charged as adults.
Analysis
The bill repeals the following exclusions from the juvenile court’s jurisdiction:
 a child at least age 14 alleged to have committed an act that, if committed by an adult,
would be a crime punishable by life imprisonment;
 a child at least age 16 and alleged to have committed abduction, kidnapping, robbery under
§ 3-403 of the Criminal Law Article, third-degree sexual offense under § 3-307(a)(1) of
the Criminal Law Article, first-degree assault under § 3-202 of the Criminal Law Article,
or attempted robbery under § 3-403 of the Criminal Law Article;
HB 1433/ Page 1

 a child at least age 16 and alleged to have committed a crime in violation of § 5-133
(possession of a regulated firearm), § 5-134 (sale, rental, or transfer of a regulated firearm),
§ 5-138 (sale, transfer, or disposal of a stolen regulated firearm), or § 5-203 (possession of
a short-barreled rifle or short-barreled shotgun) of the Public Safety Article;
 a child at least age 16 and alleged to have committed a crime in violation of § 4-203
(wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun), § 4-404 (use of a machine gun in a crime
of violence), § 4-405 (use of a machine gun for an aggressive purpose), § 5-621 (firearm
in connection to a drug trafficking crime), or § 5-622 (possession of firearm after
conviction) of the Criminal Law Article; or
 a child previously convicted as an adult of a felony who is subsequently alleged to have
committed an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult.
The bill would establish original jurisdiction in the juvenile court for the aforementioned offenses.
Under the bill, cases involving juveniles age 14 and 15 charged with offenses punishable by life
imprisonment would be heard in the juvenile court, while juveniles age 16 and above who are
similarly charged would have their cases heard in the circuit court.
Current Law:
Juvenile Court Jurisdiction
In general, the juvenile court has jurisdiction over children at least age 13 who are alleged to be
delinquent, in need of supervision, or who have received a citation for specified violations. The
juvenile court also has jurisdiction over peace order proceedings in which the respondent is a child.
The juvenile court also has jurisdiction in certain cases involving children between the ages of 10
and 12 who commit specified violent crimes or sex offenses.
The juvenile court does not have jurisdiction over (1) a child at least age 14 alleged to have
committed an act which, if committed by an adult, would be a crime punishable by life
imprisonment; (2) a child at least age 16 alleged to have violated specified traffic or boating laws;
(3) a child at least age 16 alleged to have committed specified crimes (violent crimes, firearms
crimes, etc.); or (4) a child who previously has been convicted as an adult of a felony and is
subsequently alleged to have committed an act that would be a felony if committed by an adult.
These cases are tried in adult criminal court.
However, for items (1), (3), and (4) above, the adult criminal court may transfer the case back to
juvenile court before trial or before a plea is entered if the court determines from a preponderance
of the evidence that the transfer is in the interest of the child or society and specified conditions
are met. This is often referred to as a “reverse waiver.” A reverse waiver is not permitted in certain
circumstances, such as when the child was previously convicted in an unrelated case excluded
from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court or when the alleged crime is murder in the first degree
and the accused child was at least age 16 when the alleged crime was committed.
The juvenile court may waive its jurisdiction (which transfers the case to adult court) with respect
to a petition alleging delinquency if the petition concerns a child who is at least age 15 or a child
HB 1433/ Page 2

who is charged with committing an act which, if committed by an adult, would be punishable by
life imprisonment. The court may waive its jurisdiction only after it has conducted a waiver hearing
held prior to the adjudicatory hearing and after notice has been given to all parties. The court may
not waive its jurisdiction over a case unless it determines, from a preponderance of the evidence
presented at the hearing, that the child is an unfit subject for juvenile rehabilitative measures.
Juvenile Court Dispositions
Generally, a disposition hearing is held by the juvenile court to determine whether a child who has
been adjudicated delinquent needs or requires the court’s guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation
and, if so, the nature of the guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation. Among other options, and subject
to specified limitations, a juvenile court may:
 place the child on probation or under supervision in the child’s own home or in the custody
or under the guardianship of a relative or other fit person, on terms the court deems
appropriate, including community detention;
 commit the child to the custody or guardianship of the Department of Juvenile Services
(DJS) or other agency on terms that the court considers appropriate, including designation
of the type of facility where the child is to be accommodated; or
 order the child or the child’s parents, guardian, or custodian to participate in rehabilitative
services that are in the best interest of the child and the family.
Demographics of Youth in the Criminal Justice System
Nationally, youth of color are overrepresented in the criminal justice system, including within the
juvenile justice system. For example, according to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the
referral rate for delinquency cases involving Black youth in 2021 was about three times the rate
for white youth. In addition, DOJ indicated that cases were more likely to be petitioned for formal
processing for Black youth than for white youth.
In Maryland, notable patterns of racial and ethnic inequities exist statewide among youth charged
with crimes of violence heard in the juvenile court as well as for youth charged as an adult who
must appear in circuit court.
In 2020, Maryland’s estimated population for individuals under 18 years of age was approximately
1.3 million. As shown in Exhibit 1, 59% of this population identify as non-white or as youth of
color.

Juvenile Justice Data Reporting in Maryland
The Maryland Statistical Analysis Center (MSAC) within the Governor’s Office of Crime
Prevention and Policy (GOCPP) is required to research and evaluate data pertaining to juveniles
charged as adults in the State. This data is reported monthly to GOCPP by the Criminal Justice
Information System Central Repository. MSAC must submit semiannual reports addressing the
results of its research data to the Governor and the General Assembly. The reports include criminal
justice data and information on gender, race, and age.
In fiscal 2023, GOCPP reported a total of 737 youth were charged as adults for crimes of violence
(i.e., exclusionary offenses) by the State. As shown in Exhibit 2, 81% of these individuals were
youth of color, with the majority being Black individuals.

DJS annually reports juvenile data in its resource data guide. In fiscal 2024, DJS reported a total
of 604 youth were adjudicated for crimes of violence. Of the 604 youth, 89% are youth of color.
DJS does not currently distinguish between racial minorities in its reporting, so the data includes
all racial minorities (the great proportion of which are Black youth) as well as Hispanic youth.
Exhibit 3 compares the racial distribution for youth charged with crimes of violence as adults in
the circuit court and those adjudicated as juveniles during fiscal 2024.

The circuit court and juvenile court processes share similar racial distributions for youth charged
with crimes of violence. In the circuit court, 81% of youth charged as an adult for crimes of
violence are youth of color compared to 89% of youth of color adjudicated as a juvenile. White
youth encompass 19% of cases charged for these crimes as an adult in circuit court and 11% of
adjudicated juvenile court cases.
Racial Disproportionality and Disparity Ratios in the Juvenile Court System
As seen in Exhibit 4, just as youth of color are overrepresented on both the circuit court and
juvenile court dockets for crimes of violence, they are similarly overrepresented as compared to
their share of the overall population under 18 years of age. These statistics provide evidence of
substantial disproportionality in the proportion of youth of color charged with crimes of violence.

Specifically, Exhibit 5 shows that there is a disproportionality ratio of 1.50 for charges of crimes
of violence by youth of color adjudicated in the juvenile court. Since this ratio is greater than 1.00,
it means that juveniles of color are overrepresented, or more likely to be charged, given their share
of the overall under age 18 population in the State. The disproportionality ratio of 0.27 for white
youth means that white juveniles are significantly less likely to be charged when compared to their
proportion of the overall under age 18 population in Maryland.
Exhibit 5 also shows how racial disparity ratios vary for youths charged with crimes of violence
in the juvenile court. The disparity ratio of 5.55 for youth of color under age 18 means those youth
are five and a half times more likely to be charged for crimes of violence than their white peers in
juvenile court.

Racial Disproportionality and Disparity Ratios for Juveniles Charged as Adults
For youth charged as an adult for crimes of violence heard in the circuit court, Exhibit 6 shows
that the disproportionality ratio for youth of color is 1.37. This means youth of color who are
charged as adults are slightly overrepresented in cases adjudicated by the circuit court and are more
likely to be charged as adults for crimes of violence compared to their share of the overall State
population. The disproportionality ratio for white youth charged as adults is 0.46, which means
that white youth are less likely to be charged as adults for these types of crimes.
Exhibit 6 also shows how disparity ratios vary by race for crimes of violence charges adjudicated
in the circuit court. The disparity ratio of 2.97 for youth of color means those youth are almost
three times more likely to be charged as an adult for a crime of violence than their white peers.

Conclusion
Youth of color, especially Black youth, are overrepresented and disparately impacted by crimes of
violence charges whether adjudicated in juvenile court or circuit court. Because youth of color
charged as adults are overrepresented in the courts to a greater extent than white youth, they could
experience harsher punitive outcomes as a result.
While the bill’s provisions would not directly affect charge inequities between racial groups, it
will significantly impact youth of color whose cases are heard in the circuit court under current
law but under the bill’s provisions would instead be adjudicated by the juvenile court. Juveniles
under jurisdiction of the juvenile court will likely have more access to coordinated resources,
individualized treatment, and a continuum of care not available in the adult system. The bill may
also positively affect the general health and welfare of all juveniles in the system. Previous studies
have shown that transfer to the adult criminal justice system typically increases rates of violence
among transferred youth.

Methodologies, Assumptions, and Uncertainties
This analysis includes data for youths charged with crimes of violence in both the circuit court and
the juvenile court. The definition of crimes of violence differs slightly in each court but are mostly
the same. The disproportionality and disparity ratios are calculated based on these separate
groupings and are meant to illustrate general inequities in each court’s defendant population
separately, and not comparatively.
Although some reports use disparity and disproportionality interchangeably, this racial equity
impact note distinguishes them. Disproportionality is the state of being out of proportion. It
compares the proportion of one racial or ethnic group of a target population to the proportion of
the same racial or ethnic demographic group in the general population. Disparity, however, refers
to a state of being unequal. A disparity describes an unequal outcome experienced by one racial or
ethnic group of the target population as contrast against a different racial or ethnic group in the
target population. The information provided in this note is drawn from quantitative data analysis
of available statistical datasets on crime and criminal justice collected by entities at the national
and state level. Moreover, the information includes scholarly literature on racial and ethnic
disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest single race
demographic group in the State of Maryland comprising 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national population, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black
or African American, with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black or African
American and another 2.5% identifying as Black in combination with some other race. Maryland’s
Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher than the Asian share of the national population of
6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity, however, is slightly less diverse than the
U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19%
of the U.S. population.
