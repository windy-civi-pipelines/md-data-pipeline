Article – Real Property
8–402.
(a) (1) A tenant under any periodic tenancy, or at the expiration of a lease, and

(ii) The court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for the
damages determined to be due together with costs of the suit if the court finds that the
residential tenant was personally served with a summons, or, in the case of a nonresidential

would support a judgment in contract or tort.
