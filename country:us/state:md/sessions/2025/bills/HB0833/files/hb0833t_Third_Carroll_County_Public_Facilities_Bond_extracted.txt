18 authorized to finance any part or all of the costs of the construction, improvements, or
19 development of public facilities described in Section 1 of this Act, to make loans to each and
20 every volunteer fire department in the County upon such terms and conditions as may be
21 determined by the County for the purpose of financing certain fire or emergency–related
22 equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire departments, and to borrow money
23 and incur indebtedness for those purposes, at one time or from time to time, in an amount
24 not exceeding, in the aggregate, $36,900,000 and to evidence such borrowing by the
25 issuance and sale upon its full faith and credit of general obligation bonds in like par
26 amount, which may be issued at one time or from time to time, in one or more groups or
27 series, as the County may determine.
28 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the bonds shall be issued in

31 fire or emergency–related equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire
32 departments in the County for which the proceeds of the bond sale are intended and the

34 complete authority and discretion in the resolution to fix and determine with respect to the
35 bonds of any issue: the designation, date of issue, denomination or denominations, form or
36 forms, and tenor of the bonds which, without limitation, may be issued in registered form

15 such officer before the delivery thereof, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and
16 sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery. The
17 bonds and the issuance and sale thereof shall be exempt from the provisions of §§ 19–205

30 as the security for the payment of the bonds, the exemption of the bonds from State, County,
31 municipal, or other taxation, and authorization to issue refunding bonds and the limitation
32 on the aggregate principal amount of bonds authorized for issuance, shall be applicable to
33 installment purchase obligations.
34 The County may enter into agreements with agents, banks, fiduciaries, insurers, or
35 others for the purpose of enhancing the marketability of any security for the bonds and for
36 the purpose of securing any tender option that may be granted to holders of the bonds, all
37 as may be determined and presented in the aforesaid resolution, which may (but need not)
38 state as security for the performance by the County of any monetary obligations under such
39 agreements the same security given by the County to bondholders for the performance by
40 the County of its monetary obligations under the bonds.
41 If the County determines in the resolution to offer any of the bonds by solicitation of
42 competitive bids at public sale, the resolution shall fix the terms and conditions of the public
43 sale and shall adopt a form of notice of sale, which shall outline the terms and conditions,
4 HOUSE BILL 833

7 be made to the Comptroller of Carroll County or such other official of Carroll County as
8 may be designated to receive such payment in a resolution passed by the County before
9 such delivery.
10 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the net proceeds of the sale
11 of bonds shall be used and applied exclusively and solely for the acquisition, construction,
12 improvement, or development of public facilities, including water and sewer projects, to
13 make loans to volunteer fire departments for the financing of fire or emergency–related
14 equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire departments in the County for
15 which the bonds are sold. If the amounts borrowed shall prove inadequate to finance the
16 projects described in the resolution, the County may issue additional bonds with the
17 limitations hereof for the purpose of evidencing the borrowing of additional funds for such
18 financing, provided the resolution authorizing the sale of additional bonds shall so recite,
19 but if the net proceeds of the sale of any issue of bonds exceed the amount needed to finance
20 the projects described in the resolution, the excess funds so borrowed and not expended
21 shall be applied to the payment of the next principal maturity of the bonds or to the
22 redemption of any part of the bonds which have been made redeemable or to the purchase
23 and cancellation of bonds, unless the County shall adopt a resolution allocating the excess
24 funds to the acquisition, construction, improvement, or development of other public
25 facilities, including water and sewer projects, or to the making of loans for fire or
26 emergency–related equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire departments
27 in the County, as defined and within the limits set forth in this Act.
28 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the bonds hereby authorized
29 shall constitute, and they shall so recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit
30 and unlimited taxing power of the County to the payment of the maturing principal of and
31 interest on the bonds as and when they become payable. In each and every fiscal year that
32 any of the bonds are outstanding, the County shall levy or cause to be levied ad valorem
33 taxes upon all the assessable property within the corporate limits of the County in rate and
34 amount sufficient to provide for or assure the payment, when due, of the principal of and
35 interest on all the bonds maturing in each such fiscal year and, in the event the proceeds
36 from the taxes so levied in any such fiscal year shall prove inadequate for such payment,
37 additional taxes shall be levied in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any such deficiency.
38 The County may apply to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued
39 hereunder any funds received by it as loan repayments from volunteer fire departments
40 and any funds received by it from the State of Maryland, the United States of America, any
41 agency or instrumentality thereof, or from any other source, if such funds are granted for
42 the purpose of assisting the County in financing the acquisition, construction,
43 improvement, or development of the public facilities defined in this Act, including the water
44 and sewer projects or the making of loans for the aforementioned fire or emergency–related
HOUSE BILL 833 5
1 equipment, buildings, or other facilities for volunteer fire departments in the County and,
2 to the extent of any such funds received or receivable in any fiscal year, the taxes that are
3 required to be levied may be reduced accordingly.
4 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County is further
5 authorized and empowered, at any time and from time to time, to issue its bonds in the
6 manner herein above described for the purpose of refunding, by payment at maturity or
7 upon purchase or redemption, any bonds issued hereunder. The validity of any such
8 refunding bonds shall in no way be dependent upon or related to the validity or invalidity
9 of the obligations so refunded. The powers herein granted with respect to the issuance of
10 bonds shall be applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be
11 issued by the County for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any of its outstanding
12 bonds issued hereunder at maturity, for the purpose of providing it with funds to purchase
13 in the open market any of its outstanding bonds issued hereunder, prior to the maturity
14 thereof, or for the purpose of providing it with funds for the redemption prior to maturity
15 of any outstanding bonds issued hereunder which are, by their terms, redeemable, for the
16 purpose of providing it with funds to pay interest on any outstanding bonds issued
17 hereunder prior to their payment at maturity of purchase or redemption in advance of
18 maturity, or for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any redemption or purchase
19 premium in connection with the refunding of any of its outstanding bonds issued
20 hereunder. The proceeds of the sale of any such refunding bonds shall be segregated and
21 set apart by the County as a separate trust fund to be used solely for the purpose of paying
22 the purchase or redemption prices of the bonds to be refunded.
23 SECTION 7. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County may, prior to the
24 preparation of definitive bonds, issue interim certificates or temporary bonds, exchangeable
25 for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for such
26 delivery, provided, however, that any such interim certificates or temporary bonds shall be
27 issued in all respects subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Act. The
28 County may, by appropriate resolution, provide for the replacement of any bonds issued
29 hereunder which shall have become mutilated or lost or destroyed upon such conditions
30 and after receiving such indemnity as the County may require.
31 SECTION 8. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any and all obligations issued
32 pursuant to the authority of this Act, their transfer, the interest payable thereon, and any
33 income derived therefrom in the hands of the holders thereof from time to time (including
34 any profit made in the sale thereof) shall be and are hereby declared to be at all times
35 exempt from State, County, municipal, or other taxation of every kind and nature
36 whatsoever within the State of Maryland. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the County
37 from authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable
38 from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
39 SECTION 9. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the authority to borrow
40 money and issue bonds conferred on the County by this Act shall be deemed to provide an
41 additional and alternative authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as
42 supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the County by other laws and shall
43 not be regarded as in derogation of any power now existing; and all Acts of the General
6 HOUSE BILL 833
1 Assembly of Maryland heretofore passed authorizing the County to borrow money are
2 hereby continued to the extent that the powers contained in such Acts have not been
3 exercised, and nothing contained in this Act may be construed to impair, in any way, the
4 validity of any bonds that may have been issued by the County under the authority of any
5 said Acts, and the validity of the bonds is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. This
6 Act, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of Carroll County, shall be liberally
7 construed to effect the purposes hereof. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with the
8 provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.

10 June 1, 2025.

19 but if the net proceeds of the sale of any issue of bonds exceed the amount needed to finance
20 the projects described in the resolution, the excess funds so borrowed and not expended
21 shall be applied to the payment of the next principal maturity of the bonds or to the
22 redemption of any part of the bonds which have been made redeemable or to the purchase
23 and cancellation of bonds, unless the County shall adopt a resolution allocating the excess
24 funds to the acquisition, construction, improvement, or development of other public
25 facilities, including water and sewer projects, or to the making of loans for fire or
26 emergency–related equipment, buildings, or other facilities of volunteer fire departments
27 in the County, as defined and within the limits set forth in this Act.
28 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the bonds hereby authorized
29 shall constitute, and they shall so recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit
30 and unlimited taxing power of the County to the payment of the maturing principal of and
31 interest on the bonds as and when they become payable. In each and every fiscal year that
32 any of the bonds are outstanding, the County shall levy or cause to be levied ad valorem
33 taxes upon all the assessable property within the corporate limits of the County in rate and
34 amount sufficient to provide for or assure the payment, when due, of the principal of and
35 interest on all the bonds maturing in each such fiscal year and, in the event the proceeds
36 from the taxes so levied in any such fiscal year shall prove inadequate for such payment,
37 additional taxes shall be levied in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any such deficiency.
38 The County may apply to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued
39 hereunder any funds received by it as loan repayments from volunteer fire departments
40 and any funds received by it from the State of Maryland, the United States of America, any
41 agency or instrumentality thereof, or from any other source, if such funds are granted for
42 the purpose of assisting the County in financing the acquisition, construction,
43 improvement, or development of the public facilities defined in this Act, including the water
44 and sewer projects or the making of loans for the aforementioned fire or emergency–related

HOUSE BILL 833 5
1 equipment, buildings, or other facilities for volunteer fire departments in the County and,
2 to the extent of any such funds received or receivable in any fiscal year, the taxes that are
3 required to be levied may be reduced accordingly.
4 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County is further
5 authorized and empowered, at any time and from time to time, to issue its bonds in the
6 manner herein above described for the purpose of refunding, by payment at maturity or
7 upon purchase or redemption, any bonds issued hereunder. The validity of any such
8 refunding bonds shall in no way be dependent upon or related to the validity or invalidity
9 of the obligations so refunded. The powers herein granted with respect to the issuance of
10 bonds shall be applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be
11 issued by the County for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any of its outstanding
12 bonds issued hereunder at maturity, for the purpose of providing it with funds to purchase
13 in the open market any of its outstanding bonds issued hereunder, prior to the maturity
14 thereof, or for the purpose of providing it with funds for the redemption prior to maturity
15 of any outstanding bonds issued hereunder which are, by their terms, redeemable, for the
16 purpose of providing it with funds to pay interest on any outstanding bonds issued
17 hereunder prior to their payment at maturity of purchase or redemption in advance of
18 maturity, or for the purpose of providing it with funds to pay any redemption or purchase
19 premium in connection with the refunding of any of its outstanding bonds issued
20 hereunder. The proceeds of the sale of any such refunding bonds shall be segregated and
21 set apart by the County as a separate trust fund to be used solely for the purpose of paying
22 the purchase or redemption prices of the bonds to be refunded.
23 SECTION 7. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the County may, prior to the
24 preparation of definitive bonds, issue interim certificates or temporary bonds, exchangeable
25 for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for such
26 delivery, provided, however, that any such interim certificates or temporary bonds shall be
27 issued in all respects subject to the restrictions and requirements set forth in this Act. The
28 County may, by appropriate resolution, provide for the replacement of any bonds issued
29 hereunder which shall have become mutilated or lost or destroyed upon such conditions
30 and after receiving such indemnity as the County may require.
31 SECTION 8. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That any and all obligations issued
32 pursuant to the authority of this Act, their transfer, the interest payable thereon, and any
33 income derived therefrom in the hands of the holders thereof from time to time (including
34 any profit made in the sale thereof) shall be and are hereby declared to be at all times
35 exempt from State, County, municipal, or other taxation of every kind and nature
36 whatsoever within the State of Maryland. Nothing in this Act shall prevent the County
37 from authorizing the issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable
38 from gross income for federal income tax purposes.
39 SECTION 9. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the authority to borrow
40 money and issue bonds conferred on the County by this Act shall be deemed to provide an
41 additional and alternative authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as
42 supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the County by other laws and shall
43 not be regarded as in derogation of any power now existing; and all Acts of the General

6 HOUSE BILL 833
1 Assembly of Maryland heretofore passed authorizing the County to borrow money are
2 hereby continued to the extent that the powers contained in such Acts have not been
3 exercised, and nothing contained in this Act may be construed to impair, in any way, the
4 validity of any bonds that may have been issued by the County under the authority of any
5 said Acts, and the validity of the bonds is hereby ratified, confirmed, and approved. This
6 Act, being necessary for the welfare of the inhabitants of Carroll County, shall be liberally
7 construed to effect the purposes hereof. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with the
8 provisions of this Act are hereby repealed to the extent of such inconsistency.
9 SECTION 10. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
10 June 1, 2025.
