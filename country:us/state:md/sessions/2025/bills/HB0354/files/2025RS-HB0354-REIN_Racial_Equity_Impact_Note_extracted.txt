2025 Session
HB0354
Transporting a Handgun - Penalties
Bill Summary
This bill (1) establishes a “knowingly” intent element for a person wearing, carrying, or
transporting a handgun, whether concealed or open, on the person; (2) repeals the prohibition on a
person wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, whether concealed or open, about the person;
and (3) repeals the rebuttable presumption that a person who transports a handgun, whether
concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public,
highway, waterway, or airway of the State, transports the handgun knowingly. In addition, the bill
alters the penalty for a person who is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing a firearm if
the person knowingly violates prohibitions against (1) wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun, whether concealed or open, on the person; (2) wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used
by the public, highway, waterway, or airway of the State; or (3) violating either item (1) or (2)
with a handgun loaded with ammunition. The penalty is a maximum $1,000 fine instead of
imprisonment for at least 30 days and up to five years and/or a fine of $250 to $2,500.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill modifies the culpability standards for illegal possession of a handgun, repeals the
prohibition on “constructive possession” of a handgun, and removes the imprisonment penalty for
individuals who violate specified illegal possession provisions but are otherwise eligible to receive
a handgun permit. The bill would allow many individuals to avoid incarceration for mere
possession of a handgun and decrease penalties and convictions for nonviolent, and in some cases,
unknowing offenders. The population of arrestees for handgun possession offenses under existing
law is comprised overwhelmingly of Black individuals. Data from the Department of State Police
(DSP) suggests that significant disproportionate and disparate impacts exist for the Black offender
population arrested and convicted for illegal wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in a
HB 354/ Page 1
vehicle. It is unclear whether and to what extent the bill’s changes would reduce arrests for the
specified violations.
Analysis
Under existing law, with specified exceptions, including possession of a handgun permit, a person
may not (1) wear, carry, or transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or about the person;
(2) wear, carry, or knowingly transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle
traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public, highway, waterway, or airway of
the State; (3) violate items (1) or (2) listed above while on public school property in the State;
(4) violate items (1) or (2) listed above with the deliberate purpose of injuring or killing another
person; or (5) violate items (1) or (2) listed above with a handgun loaded with ammunition. There
is a rebuttable presumption that a person who transports a handgun does so knowingly. A violator
is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties listed below. The subsequent offender
provisions apply to previous convictions under § 4-203 (wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun), § 4-204 (use of handgun or antique firearm in commission of crime), § 4-101 (dangerous
weapons), and § 4-102 (deadly weapons on school property) of the Criminal Law Article, as shown
in Exhibit 1.
Exhibit 1

The bill establishes an intent requirement for the prohibition on transporting a handgun in a vehicle
and for the prohibition on wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun on one’s person. It also
repeals the prohibition on transporting a handgun near or “about” one’s person. This change would
likely reduce the potential liability for “constructive possession” of a handgun, which could occur
in cases such as when an individual is in proximity of a handgun. The bill also reduces penalties
for illegal possession for individuals who do not possess a handgun permit but would be eligible
for a permit under existing law.
Impacts of the Bill
Statewide data suggests that Black individuals are overwhelmingly charged, arrested, and
convicted for the handgun violations modified by the bill. The district and circuit courts report that
for fiscal 2024, the total violations adjudicated for both illegal possession of a handgun on or about
a person or in a vehicle (loaded and unloaded) totaled 8,847 and 5,582 violations, respectively. In
contrast, only 78 convictions were handed down by the District Court and 173 in the circuit court,
for a conviction rate of less than 2%. This data suggests that law enforcement arrests for these
offenses rarely end in conviction despite the strict liability for wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun on one’s person and the presumption in statute that a person is knowingly transporting a
handgun while in a vehicle. Despite the low conviction rate, drivers who are arrested for violating
handgun possession laws must deal with the adverse consequences of having an arrest on their
record as well as any potential time spent on probation.
Traffic Stop Arrests for Violating § 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article
Longitudinal data shows that Black drivers are disproportionately subjected to traffic stops by law
enforcement. Traffic stops often lead to searches and arrests. According to data collected from
DSP and reported by the Governor’s Office of Crime Prevention and Policy, in 2023 there were a
total of 221 traffic stop arrests for all offenses relating to § 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article,
which includes various prohibitions on wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun. The bill
would apply an intent requirement to all of these offenses. Exhibit 2 illustrates the percentage of
traffic stop arrests by race and ethnicity. Of the 221 arrests, 86% of the arrestees were Black, 9%
were white, 4% were Hispanic, and 1% were categorized as “other” by the reported agency.

In addition, the data shows that 73% of the traffic stop arrests were due to searches by law

Arrests for Handgun-related Weapons Law Violations
The DSP crime reporting program is currently in the process of moving from its current reporting
system to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) National Incident Based Reporting System
(NIBRS). Effective January 1, 2021, the FBI mandated this change in crime reporting from the
existing Summary Reporting System (SRS) to NIBRS. The move to NIBRS is designed to improve
the quality and quantity of crime data collected by law enforcement agencies. As of
November 15, 2024, most law enforcement agencies in Maryland have completed the transition to
NIBRS. This includes all primary agencies (county police/sheriff) in 22 counties and Baltimore
City. The 2023 data cited in this analysis reflects 16 SRS reporting agencies with the remaining
agencies reporting using NIBRS.
In 2023, the NIBRS reporting agencies reported approximately 1,700 arrests involving
handgun-related weapons law violations. These violations are defined as the violation of laws or
ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale, purchase, transportation, possession, concealment or
use of firearms, cutting instruments, explosives, incendiary devices, or other deadly weapons. The
arrest data demonstrate that Black individuals are significantly overrepresented in handgun-related
weapons law violations relative to other racial and ethnic groups as they comprise 87% of total
arrests. Exhibit 3 shows the demographic breakdown in relation to each group’s share of the
State’s overall population.

Racial Disproportionality and Disparity in Arrests for Handgun-related Weapons Law Violations
When compared to their share of the overall State population, Black offenders are significantly
overrepresented in arrests for handgun-related weapons law violations. Exhibit 4 shows the
disproportionality and disparity ratios by race and ethnicity from the DSP data. The
disproportionality ratio for the Black population is 3.00. This means that Black individuals are
three times more likely to be arrested for a handgun-related weapons law violation in Maryland
given their share of the adult population in the State. The disproportionality ratios for the other
racial and ethnic groups are significantly less than 1.00, which means these individuals are
considerably less likely to be sentenced under the statute as compared to their share of the overall
adult population.

The disparity ratio illustrates inequities in outcomes when comparing one or more racial or ethnic
groups within a dataset to the white population within that same dataset. In this instance, the
disparity ratio for Black arrestees is 21.39. This means that Black individuals are over 21 times
more likely to be arrested for a handgun-related weapons law violation relative to their white peers.
In addition, Hispanic individuals are more than 3 times as likely to be arrested for a
handgun-related weapons law violation relative to their white peers.
Conclusion
The bill’s removal of the incarceration penalty for specified individuals will decrease
incarcerations for a subset of individuals eligible for a handgun permit. The exact impact of this
change would depend on the proportion of individuals arrested for illegal carry or transport of a
handgun who are otherwise eligible for a handgun permit in Maryland. There is no data currently
available to determine the number of individuals impacted by the change. The bill’s alterations to
statutory culpability standards will likely decrease convictions for a population of arrestees that
are comprised overwhelmingly of Black individuals, but no data is available to determine how this
would impact the number and frequency of traffic stop and other arrests for illegal handgun
HB 354/ Page 6
possession. Repeal of the constructive possessio n element of the handgun possession offense is
the most likely portion of the bill that would impact arrests in a meaningful way. The magnitude
of the impact would depend on how the change is implemented by law enforcement and
prosecutors in the State.
Significant disproportionate and disparate impacts exist for the Black offender population and, in
some cases, the Hispanic offender population arrested, charged, and convicted for illegally
wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun in a vehicle. The data discussed in this analysis does
not explain the actual causes of the overrepresentation but is indicative of systemic inequities
observed generally in statewide criminal justice data. Additional reliable data pertaining to (1) the
percentage of convicted offenders under § 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article eligible for a handgun
permit; (2) the demographics and distribution of traffic stop arrests by each separate offense in

Section 6:
§ 4-203 of the Criminal Law Article; (3) the number and percentage of those charged and arrested
for constructive possession under the statute; and (4) the economic impact of the bill’s fine-only
penalty on racial and ethnic populations is needed to determine the specific equity impacts.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.

person wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun, whether concealed or open, about the person;
and (3) repeals the rebuttable presumption that a person who transports a handgun, whether
concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public,
highway, waterway, or airway of the State, transports the handgun knowingly. In addition, the bill
alters the penalty for a person who is not otherwise prohibited by law from possessing a firearm if
the person knowingly violates prohibitions against (1) wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun, whether concealed or open, on the person; (2) wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle traveling on a road or parking lot generally used
by the public, highway, waterway, or airway of the State; or (3) violating either item (1) or (2)
with a handgun loaded with ammunition. The penalty is a maximum $1,000 fine instead of
imprisonment for at least 30 days and up to five years and/or a fine of $250 to $2,500.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill modifies the culpability standards for illegal possession of a handgun, repeals the
prohibition on “constructive possession” of a handgun, and removes the imprisonment penalty for
individuals who violate specified illegal possession provisions but are otherwise eligible to receive

vehicle. It is unclear whether and to what extent the bill’s changes would reduce arrests for the
specified violations.
Analysis
Under existing law, with specified exceptions, including possession of a handgun permit, a person
may not (1) wear, carry, or transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, on or about the person;
(2) wear, carry, or knowingly transport a handgun, whether concealed or open, in a vehicle
traveling on a road or parking lot generally used by the public, highway, waterway, or airway of
the State; (3) violate items (1) or (2) listed above while on public school property in the State;
(4) violate items (1) or (2) listed above with the deliberate purpose of injuring or killing another
person; or (5) violate items (1) or (2) listed above with a handgun loaded with ammunition. There
is a rebuttable presumption that a person who transports a handgun does so knowingly. A violator
is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to the penalties listed below. The subsequent offender
provisions apply to previous convictions under § 4-203 (wearing, carrying, or transporting a
handgun), § 4-204 (use of handgun or antique firearm in commission of crime), § 4-101 (dangerous
weapons), and § 4-102 (deadly weapons on school property) of the Criminal Law Article, as shown
in Exhibit 1.

Racial Disproportionality and Disparity in Arrests for Handgun-related Weapons Law Violations
When compared to their share of the overall State population, Black offenders are significantly
overrepresented in arrests for handgun-related weapons law violations. Exhibit 4 shows the
disproportionality and disparity ratios by race and ethnicity from the DSP data. The
disproportionality ratio for the Black population is 3.00. This means that Black individuals are
three times more likely to be arrested for a handgun-related weapons law violation in Maryland
given their share of the adult population in the State. The disproportionality ratios for the other
racial and ethnic groups are significantly less than 1.00, which means these individuals are
considerably less likely to be sentenced under the statute as compared to their share of the overall

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
