16 have been unable to accept the contracts;
17 (3) some individuals are unable to obtain government and other contracts

24 socially or economically disadvantaged individuals with insufficient records of
25 performance;
26 (6) the inability of businesses owned by socially or economically
27 disadvantaged individuals to obtain long–term financing is a major limitation on their
28 opportunity to survive and expand; and
29 (7) the public welfare is served by promoting the viability and expansion of
30 businesses owned by economically or socially disadvantaged individuals, retaining or
31 increasing the employment of these individuals, and expanding the taxable base of the
32 economy of the State.
