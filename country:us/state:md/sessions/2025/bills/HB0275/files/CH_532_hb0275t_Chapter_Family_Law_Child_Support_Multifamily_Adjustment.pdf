Ch. 532 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
(ii) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the
application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.
(iii) In determining whether the application of the guidelines would
be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court may consider ANY FINANCIAL
CONSIDERATIONS:
1. [the terms of any] SPECIFIED IN AN existing separation

debts, [payment of] OR college education expenses[,];
B. the terms of any use and possession order or right to
occupy the family home under an agreement[,]; AND

required by THE agreement or order[, or any other financial considerations set out in an
existing separation or property settlement agreement or court order];
2. [the presence in the household of either parent of other
children to whom that parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent
is directly contributing; and] THAT THE COURT DEEMS RELEVANT TO THE BEST
INTERESTS OF THE CHILD WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE CHILD SUPPORT ORDER; OR
3. [whether an obligor’s monthly child support obligation]
THAT would leave the obligor with a monthly actual income below 110% of the 2019 federal
poverty level for an individual.
(iv) [The presumption may not be rebutted solely on the basis of
evidence of the presence in the household of either parent of other children to whom that
parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly
contributing.

guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court shall make a
written finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the
guidelines.
2. The court’s finding shall state:
A. the amount of child support that would have been required
under the guidelines;
– 4 –

B. how the order varies from the guidelines;
C. how the finding serves the best interests of the child WHO
IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ORDER; and
D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a
portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items
conveyed.
12–204.
(a) (1) The basic child support obligation shall be determined in accordance
with the schedule of basic child support obligations in subsection (e) of this section. The
basic child support obligation shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their
adjusted actual incomes.
(2) (i) If one or both parents have made a request for alimony or
maintenance in the proceeding in which a child support award is sought, the court shall
decide the issue and amount of alimony or maintenance before determining the child
support obligation under these guidelines.
(ii) If the court awards alimony or maintenance, the amount of
alimony or maintenance awarded shall be considered actual income for the recipient of the
alimony or maintenance and shall be subtracted from the income of the payor of the alimony
or maintenance under [§ 12–201(c)(2)] § 12–201(C)(1)(II) of this subtitle before the court
determines the amount of a child support award.
(3) THE AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE SUPPORT OF
ADDITIONAL CHILDREN LIVING IN A PARENT’S HOME DESCRIBED IN §
12–201(C)(1)(III) OF THIS SUBTITLE SHALL BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE PARENT’S
