2025 Session
HB0413
Criminal Law - Controlled Dangerous Substances and Firearms
Bill Summary
This bill (1) establishes reduced penalties for cannabis-related violations of the prohibitions on
being a volume dealer under § 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article and a drug kingpin under § 5-613
of the Criminal Law Article; (2) authorizes specified individuals incarcerated for violations of
§§ 5-612 and 5-613 to file an application for a modification or reduction of a mandatory minimum
sentence; (3) modifies penalties and crime classifications for specified firearms offenses; and
(4) authorizes a person at least age 21 to manufacture a personal use amount of cannabis products
or concentrated cannabis, as specified. The bill also specifies in statute that with the exception of
a violation involving cannabis, a violation of the volume dealer statute is a felony.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill reclassifies specified firearm offenses from misdemeanors to felonies, which includes
establishing incarceration penalties for some offenses. The overall impacts of these changes cannot
be determined due to the relatively small number of individuals charged, arrested, and convicted
of these offenses. Accordingly, the impacts are likely to be minimal to the extent that future
conviction rates follow existing trends. The reduced penalties for specified cannabis offenses and
the sentence modification provisions of the bill will positively impact those individuals convicted
and incarcerated for these offenses, but the number of individuals impacted is relatively small.
Accordingly, the overall impacts, while personally beneficial to those affected, would be minimal.
It is important to note that despite the small number of individuals affected by the bill, Black
individuals are the overwhelming majority of those arrested and/or incarcerated for the
aforementioned offenses. Accordingly, those individuals would benefit or, in the case of the bill’s
increased firearm offense penalties, be negatively impacted to the greatest extent.

Analysis
The bill generally makes changes to penalties for cannabis offenses as well as firearm offenses
related to the sale, manufacture, or transfer of firearms. The bill also establishes a process for
reducing and/or modifying a previous sentence for specified cannabis offenses. The specific
provisions are listed below:
Manufacturing Cannabis Products and Concentrated Cannabis
The bill authorizes a person who is at least age 21 to manufacture a personal use amount of
cannabis products or concentrated cannabis for personal use or adult sharing at a private residence
if the manufacturing process does not involve the use of a “volatile solvent.” A “volatile solvent”
is defined as a solvent that is or produces a flammable gas or vapor that, when present in the air in
sufficient quantities, will create explosive or ignitable mixtures.
Alteration of Classification and Penalties – Volume Dealer and Drug Kingpin Offenses
Volume Dealer: The bill establishes that a person who violates the volume dealer statute (§ 5-612
of the Criminal Law Article) by manufacturing, distributing, dispensing, or possessing 50 pounds
or more of cannabis (the quantity of cannabis specified under existing statute) is guilty of a
misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and/or
a $50,000 fine.
The remaining violations of the volume dealer statute, which apply to other types of controlled
dangerous substances (CDS), are subject to the existing penalty of imprisonment for up to 20 years
(with a mandatory minimum of sentence of 5 years) and a fine of up to $100,000. The bill also
specifies in statute that a violation of the volume dealer statute for a substance other than cannabis
is a felony. (While not specified in statute, the Maryland Sentencing Guidelines Offense Table
currently specifies that any violation of § 5-612 is a felony.)
Drug Kingpin: The bill establishes that a person who violates the drug kingpin statute (§ 5-613 of
the Criminal Law Article) by conspiring to manufacture, distribute, dispense, transport, or bring
into the State 50 pounds or more of cannabis (the quantity of cannabis specified under existing
statute) is guilty of a felony and on conviction is subject to a maximum sentence of 20 years
imprisonment and/or a $100,000 fine. The remaining violations of the drug kingpin statute, which
apply to other types of CDS, are subject to the existing penalty (felony punishable by imprisonment
for up to 40 years (with a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years) and/or a fine of up to
$1.0 million).
Authorization to Request Sentence Modification or Reduction
A person who is serving a term of confinement that includes a mandatory minimum sentence for
a violation of § 5-612 (volume dealer statute) or § 5-613 (drug kingpin statute) of the Criminal
Law Article may file an application with the court or sentence review panel by
September 30, 2026, for a modification or reduction of the mandatory minimum sentence, as
provided in Maryland Rule 4-345, regardless of whether the defendant filed a timely motion for
reconsideration or such a motion was denied by the court if:
HB 413/ Page 2

 the sentence was imposed on or before September 30, 2017, and involved less than
448 grams of cocaine base (under this scenario, only one application may be filed); or
 the sentence was imposed on or before September 30, 2025, and involved cannabis (under
this scenario, if the first motion is denied, a second application may be filed no earlier than
three years after the denial).
Alterations of Classification and Penalties – Firearm Offenses

Cannabis Reform
Adult-Use Cannabis: Pursuant to Chapter 26 of 2022 and the passage of the associated
constitutional amendment, a person at least age 21 may use and possess the personal use amount
of cannabis. Possession of the personal use amount of cannabis by a person younger than age 21
and possession of the civil use amount of cannabis by anyone are subject to civil penalties.
Possession of more than the civil use amount of cannabis by anyone is subject to a criminal penalty.
“Personal use amount” means (1) up to 1.5 ounces of usable cannabis; (2) up to 12 grams of
concentrated cannabis; (3) cannabis products containing up to 750 milligrams of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); or (4) up to 2 cannabis plants. “Civil use amount” means
(1) more than 1.5 ounces but not more than 2.5 ounces of usable cannabis; (2) more than 12 grams
but not more than 20 grams of concentrated cannabis; or (3) cannabis products containing more
than 750 milligrams but not more than 1,250 milligrams of delta-9-THC.
Impacts of the Bill
Drug Kingpin and Volume Dealers
According to the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), in 2024 there
were 37 individuals serving sentences of incarceration for violating the volume dealer and drug
kingpin prohibitions under § 5-612 or § 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article. Of these individuals,
78% are Black, 16% are white, and 5% are Hispanic. Individuals who are Asian, Native American
or Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, or of other or unknown races account for
the remaining 1% of the total. Exhibit 2 shows these percentages in relation to each group’s share
of the State’s overall population.
In addition, up to 22 individuals incarcerated under § 5-612 or § 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article
before September 30, 2017, may be eligible to apply for sentence modifications under the bill.

Conclusion
In Maryland and nationally, racial and ethnic disparities exist throughout the criminal justice
system. DPSCS and Department of State Police data reveal longstanding racial and ethnic
disparities in arrests and incarcerations relevant to the offenses outlined in this bill. However, the
number of individuals currently arrested or incarcerated for these offenses is too small to measure
specific impacts.
The bill’s reduced penalties and sentencing modifications for incarcerated individuals serving a
sentence that includes a mandatory minimum for specified offenses under the volume dealer statute
(§ 5-612 of the Criminal Law Article) or drug kingpin statute (§ 5-613 of the Criminal Law Article)
will benefit Black offenders to the greatest extent as they make up the majority of those arrested
and incarcerated for these offenses.
Additionally, the bill changes two specified firearm offenses from misdemeanors to felonies,
which will likely increase sentences and incarcerations due to more stringent penalty provisions.
However, the small number of convictions and incarcerations for these offenses makes it difficult
to assess any impacts beyond the existing racial disparities in sentencing practices.
HB 413/ Page 7

Generally, individuals convicted of felonies ofte n experience significant collateral consequences
as a result, such as losing the right to vote, disqualification from obtaining certain professional
licenses, and a prohibition on legal gun ownership. The change from a felony to a misdemeanor
for offenses involving certain amounts of cannabis may reduce some of these collateral
consequences. The change from a misdemeanor to a felony for the specified firearm offenses in
the bill will have the opposite effect.
While the data discussed in this analysis does not explain the actual causes of the
overrepresentation of arrested, convicted, and incarcerated Black offenders, it is indicative of
systemic inequities observed generally in statewide criminal justice data. Additional reliable data
on arrests, charges, convictions, parole violations, and enforcement activities would provide a
clearer picture of the specific equity impacts.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
