17 WILDLAND.
18 5–1203.
19 (a) (1) In order to assure that an increasing population, accompanied by
20 expanding settlement and growing mechanization, does not occupy and modify all areas
21 within the State, leaving no lands designated for preservation and protection in their
22 natural condition, it is the policy of the General Assembly to secure for the people of present
23 and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of State wildlands.
24 (2) For this purpose there is established a State wildlands preservation
25 system composed of areas in the State designated by the General Assembly as “wildland
26 areas”.
27 (3) The wildland areas shall be administered for the use and enjoyment of
28 the people of Maryland in a manner that will leave them unimpaired for the future use and
29 enjoyment as wildlands, to provide for their protection, preservation of their wildland
30 character, and for gathering and dissemination of information regarding their use and
31 enjoyment as wildlands.
32 (4) A State land may not be designated as a wildland area except as
33 provided for in this section or by a subsequent act.
