Section 1:
2025 Session
HB0873
Vehicle
Bill Summary
This bill expands the juvenile court’s jurisdiction to include a child who is at least age 10 and is
alleged to have committed an act that, if committed by an adult, would constitute theft of a motor
vehicle pursuant to § 7-105 of the Criminal Law Article, if the child has previously been referred
to an at-risk youth prevention and diversion program, as specified, for a violation of § 5-133
(possession of a regulated firearm); § 5-134 (sale, rental, or transfer of a regulated firearm); § 5-138
(sale, transfer, or disposal of a stolen regulated firearm); § 5-142 (removal or alteration of an
identification mark or number on a firearm); § 5-203 (possession of a short-barreled rifle or
short-barreled shotgun); or § 5-703 (untraceable firearms/violating serial number requirements for
firearms) of the Public Safety Article.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill takes specified cases involving motor vehicle theft by children younger than 13 that result
in child in need of supervision (CINS) petitions under existing law and moves them into the
juvenile court’s delinquency jurisdiction. While Black youth are overrepresented in both
Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) complaints for youth under 13 and CINS petitions, the bill
will likely apply to a small number of youth. According to DJS data for fiscal 2024, only 10
offenses for motor vehicle theft or unauthorized use of a vehicle were attributed to youth under 13.
Due to the small number of youth potentially affected by the bill, the equity impacts are likely to
be minimal.
HB 873/ Page 1
Analysis
In general, the juvenile court has jurisdiction over children who are alleged to be delinquent, a
CINS, or who have received a citation for specified violations. The juvenile court also has
jurisdiction over peace order proceedings in which the respondent is a child.
The juvenile court has jurisdiction over a child who is at least age 10 and is alleged to have
committed an act that would, if committed by an adult, be (1) a “crime of violence ” (as defined in

Section 2:
§ 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article); (2) specified crimes involving handguns and firearms;
(3) aggravated cruelty to animals; or (4) third-degree sexual offense. Outside of these
circumstances, the juvenile court does not have jurisdiction over a child younger than age 13 for
purposes of a delinquency proceeding, and such a child may not be charged with a crime. A child
of any age may be adjudicated a CINS and subject to the juvenile court’s jurisdiction under
applicable provisions.

Section 3:
Section 7-105 of the Criminal Law Article – Motor Vehicle Theft
A person may not knowingly and willfully take a motor vehicle out of the owner’s lawful custody,
control, or use without the owner’s consent. Violators are guilty of a felony and on conviction
subject to imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $5,000. Violators must restore
the motor vehicle or, if unable to restore the motor vehicle, pay the owner the full value of the
motor vehicle.
“Owner” means a person who has a lawful interest in or is in lawful possession of a motor vehicle
by consent or chain or consent of the title owner.
Child in Need of Supervision Petitions – Motor Vehicle Theft
Pursuant to Chapter 735 of 2024, if a law enforcement officer alleges that a child younger than age
13 committed an act that would constitute motor vehicle theft under § 7-105 of the Criminal Law
Article, the officer must forward the complaint to DJS to file a petition alleging that the child is in
need of supervision. Upon receipt of such a complaint, a DJS intake officer must authorize the
filing of a CINS petition, subjecting the child to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for CINS
proceedings.
Impacts of the Bill
According to DJS, for fiscal 2024, CINS offenses accounted for 48% of all intake charges for
youth younger than age 13, and 1.7% of all intake charges were for auto theft or unauthorized use
of a vehicle. No information was available regarding what portion of this total were youth that had
been previously referred to an at-risk youth prevention and diversion program for firearm offenses,
or their race or ethnicity.
While no data is available on the demographics of youth younger than 13 charged with auto theft
or unauthorized use of a vehicle, the overall composition of DJS intakes for this age group is
primarily Black youth. DJS received 1,084 complaints for youth under 13 in fiscal 2024, or 7.6%
of all complaints in that year. As shown in Exhibit 1, Black youth comprised 73% of that total,
while 21% were white youth and 6% were Hispanic youth.

Juvenile Court CINS Dispositions
In fiscal 2024, over 800 CINS offenses were assessed at intake by DJS. CINS offenses include
when a child is a danger to self and others, runaway, truant, or ungovernable. As shown in
Exhibit 2, 69% of this population are youth of color.

Conclusion
The statewide racial and ethnic demographics of complaints for youth under age 13 illustrate that
youth of color, especially Black youth, in this age group are overrepresented for DJS intake
complaints. The bill would move youth between the ages of 10 and 12 who are accused of motor
vehicle theft from CINS to the juvenile court’s delinquency jurisdiction if they have been
previously placed in an at-risk youth prevention and diversion program for specified firearm
offenses. Intake complaints for youth under age 13, however, comprise a relatively small portion
of the overall juvenile population managed by DJS and complaints for motor vehicle theft or
unauthorized use of a vehicle encompassed only a handful of individuals in fiscal 2024. Thus, the
bill’s impacts are likely to be negligible assuming current intake trends continue.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
