23 Preamble
24 WHEREAS, Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels,
25 is an immediate, grave threat to the State’s communities, environment, and economy; and
26 WHEREAS, In addition to mitigating the further buildup of greenhouse gases, the
27 State must take action to adapt to certain consequences of climate change that are
28 irreversible, including rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, extreme weather events,
29 flooding, heat waves, toxic algae blooms, and other threats; and
30 WHEREAS, Meeting the challenge of adapting to and mitigating the effects of
31 climate change will require a shared commitment of purpose and huge investments in new
32 or upgraded infrastructure; and
33 WHEREAS, The State has previously adopted programs, such as the Cigarette
34 Restitution Fund Program, to require industries that have profited by harming the public
35 welfare to shoulder their share of the burden in redressing that harm; and
36 WHEREAS, Based on decades of research, it is now possible to determine with great
37 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel

1 companies over the last 70 years or more, making it possible to assign liability and require

37 accuracy the share of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere by specific fossil fuel
