AN ACT concerning
Restrictions on Use – Solar Collector Systems – Alteration
FOR the purpose of prohibiting a restriction on use regarding land use that increases the

certain cost or that reduces the efficiency of the solar collector system by at least a
certain percentage under a certain level of energy generation; authorizing a
community association to prohibit the installation of a solar collector system in the
common area or common elements within the real estate development served by the
community association; authorizing a community association to impose reasonable

hours of the day on specified dates when direct sunlight to a specified surface of a solar
