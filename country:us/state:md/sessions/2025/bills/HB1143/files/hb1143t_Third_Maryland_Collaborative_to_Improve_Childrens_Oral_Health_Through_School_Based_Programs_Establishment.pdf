1 Preamble
2 WHEREAS, The death of Deamonte Driver, a 12–year–old insured under the

4 triggered a call to action in public health; and
5 WHEREAS, In response to Deamonte Driver’s death, the Maryland Department of
6 Health, oral health advocates, the dental provider community, and the health care
7 community collaborated to advance significant systemic improvements for access to dental
8 services for all children, including children in underserved communities in the State; and
9 WHEREAS, Access to dental services for children covered by the Maryland Medical

12 WHEREAS, Access to dental services for children covered by the Maryland Medical
13 Assistance Program remained steady between 2016 and 2019, with 63% to 64% of children
14 receiving preventive services; and
15 WHEREAS, Access to dental services for children covered by the Maryland Medical
16 Assistance Program plummeted with the onset of the COVID–19 pandemic and has yet to

18 WHEREAS, The 2022–2023 Children’s Oral Health Survey conducted by the
