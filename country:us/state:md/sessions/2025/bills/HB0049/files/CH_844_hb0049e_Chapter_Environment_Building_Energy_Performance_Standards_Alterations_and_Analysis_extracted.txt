AN ACT concerning
Environment – Building Energy Performance Standards – Compliance and
Reporting Alterations and Analysis
FOR the purpose of altering an alternative compliance fee paid by certain owners of covered
buildings under certain circumstances to include the energy use attributable to the
building’s failure to meet certain energy targets; requiring certain regulations to
include a certain annual reporting fee to cover certain costs; requiring the
Department of the Environment to deposit alternative compliance fees into the

and reporting for Building Energy Performance Standards altering the requirements
for certain regulations adopted by the Department of the Environment relating to
building energy performance standards to include certain crediting, exclusions, and
considerations, a certain alternative compliance pathway fee for energy use
attributable to a building’s failure to meet energy use intensity targets, certain
waivers from certain alternative compliance pathway fees, and a certain annual
reporting fee to cover certain costs; requiring the Department to offer certain
training to help certain energy auditors understand the requirements under the

Department shall:

(iii) recommendations on how to consider county–owned buildings,
community colleges, emergency facilities, manufacturing buildings, and residential
buildings, including considerations of tenants and condominium unit owners; and
