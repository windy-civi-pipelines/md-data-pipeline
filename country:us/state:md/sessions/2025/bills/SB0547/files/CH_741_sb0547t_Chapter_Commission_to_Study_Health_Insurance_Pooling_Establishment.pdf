AN ACT concerning
Commission to Study Health Insurance Pooling – Establishment
FOR the purpose of establishing the Commission to Study Health Insurance Pooling to
study the pooling of public employee health insurance purchasing between the State,
counties, municipal corporations, and county boards of education in the State to
maximize value and efficiency while maintaining a broad package of benefits and
reasonable premiums for public employees; and generally relating to the Commission
to Study Health Insurance Pooling.
Preamble
WHEREAS, The State perpetually faces fiscal constraints; and
WHEREAS, The State traditionally addresses fiscal constraints by cutting
expenditures or raising taxes, fees, and surcharges; and
WHEREAS, Identifying efficiencies in health insurance purchasing can both save
money and improve coverage for the State and State employees; and
WHEREAS, Currently the State, counties, municipal corporations, and county
boards of education tend to purchase health insurance without pooling purchasing; and
WHEREAS, Given the immense expense of health insurance benefits, even a small
percentage of savings would translate to significant dollar amounts; and
WHEREAS, Being part of a larger health insurance risk pool generally provides
more cost–effective coverage to members; and
WHEREAS, Several states have demonstrated that health insurance pooling for
public employees is effective at lowering health insurance costs; and
WHEREAS, The General Assembly passed House Bill 1400 of 2018 unanimously and
the Governor signed it into law, but its provisions have been underutilized; now, therefore,
SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
