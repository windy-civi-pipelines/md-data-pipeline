2 SENATE BILL 660
1 (iii) In determining whether the application of the guidelines would
2 be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court may consider:
3 1. the terms of any existing separation or property
4 settlement agreement or court order, including any provisions for payment of mortgages or
5 marital debts, payment of college education expenses, the terms of any use and possession
6 order or right to occupy the family home under an agreement, any direct payments made
7 for the benefit of the children required by agreement or order, or any other financial
8 considerations set out in an existing separation or property settlement agreement or court
9 order;
10 2. the presence in the household of either parent of other
11 children to whom that parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent
12 is directly contributing; and
13 3. whether an obligor’s monthly child support obligation
14 would leave the obligor with a monthly actual income below 110% of the 2019 federal
15 poverty level for an individual.
16 (iv) The presumption may not be rebutted solely on the basis of
17 evidence of the presence in the household of either parent of other children to whom that
18 parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly
19 contributing.
20 (V) THERE IS A PRESUMPTION THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE
21 GUIDELINES TO AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARENTS THAT DEPARTS FROM THE
22 GUIDELINES WOULD BE UNJUST OR INAPPROPRIATE IF THE PARENTS MUTUALLY
23 ASSERT THAT THE AGREEMENT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD.
24 [(v)] (VI) 1. If the court determines that the application of the
25 guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court shall make a
26 written finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the
27 guidelines.
28 2. The court’s finding shall state:
29 A. the amount of child support that would have been required
30 under the guidelines;
31 B. how the order varies from the guidelines;
32 C. how the finding serves the best interests of the child; and
33 D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a
34 portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items
35 conveyed.
