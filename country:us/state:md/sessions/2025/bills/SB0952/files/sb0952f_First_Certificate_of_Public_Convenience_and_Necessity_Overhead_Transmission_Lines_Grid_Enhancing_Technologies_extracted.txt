8 failure or when there is equipment failure at a site where critical infrastructure is located;
9 and
10 B. test and maintenance operations necessary to ensure
11 functionality of the generating unit or facility in the event of a service interruption from
12 the electric company due to electric distribution or transmission system failure or when
13 there is equipment failure at a site where critical infrastructure is located;
14 2. is installed with equipment that prevents the flow of
15 electricity to the electric grid;
16 3. is subject to a permit to construct issued by the
17 Department of the Environment; and
18 4. is installed at a facility that is part of critical
19 infrastructure if the facility complies with all applicable regulations regarding noise level

3 any surface mining area;
4 2. land excavations;
5 3. workings; and
6 4. overburden.
7 [(6)] (7) “Qualified generator lead line” means an overhead transmission
8 line that is designed to carry a voltage in excess of 69,000 volts and would allow an
9 out–of–state Tier 1 or Tier 2 renewable source to interconnect with a portion of the electric
10 system in Maryland that is owned by an electric company.
11 (f) For the construction of an overhead transmission line, in addition to the
