State's Attorneys - Reconstitution of Task Force and Establishment
of Case Management System Grant Fund
Bill Summary
This bill establishes the State’s Attorney Case Management System Grant Fund to provide grants
to State’s Attorneys’ offices to establish or improve case management systems. The bill also
reestablishes the Task Force to Study Transparency Standards for State’s Attorneys created under
Chapter 141 of 2022.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
Meaningful equity research is reliant on the continuous, effective, and uniform collection of data
for use in informed decision making by policymakers. The establishment of a Case Management
System (CMS) for State’s Attorneys as contemplated through the bill’s creation of a CMS grant
fund, in conjunction with implementation of the data collection recommendations of the Task
Force to Study Transparency Standards for State’s Attorneys, could provide new insight into the
equity impacts of prosecutorial discretion. The potential impacts of the bill on equity analysis will
depend on the implementation of specific data collection and transparency policies developed by
the task force and the level of participation by State’s Attorneys.
Analysis
This bill would reauthorize the Task Force to Study Transparency Standards for State’s Attorneys,
as well as establish a CMS grant fund for State’s Attorneys across Maryland. The CMS is defined
as an electronic program capable of collecting data on arrests, charging decisions, and other
information about cases handled by State’s Attorneys. The task force would remain active until
June 30, 2028.

Chapter 141 of 2022 initially authorized the creation of a task force to study the possibility of
establishing minimum transparency standards for State’s Attorneys in Maryland. In conducting its
study, the task force was required to (1) develop processes by which prosecutors can collect
information and determine what information should be made public and what information may be
kept private and (2) examine any existing policies of State’s Attorney offices across the State
relating to the transparency of data, the charging of crimes, and sentencing. The task force
examined best practices in data collection and transparency used in several states, including
Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, and Utah.
The task force published a report in December 2023 and found that the collection and analysis of
data gathered through a CMS will “assist prosecutors in allocating limited resources and more
efficiently and accurately handling law enforcement office functions such as compiling annual
reports, submitting budget requests, measuring staff performance and workloads, and tracking
court appearances and filing deadlines. For numerous reasons, providing the community a window
into this aggregated data can help inform critical discussions around resource allocation, equity
and disparities, seriousness and proportionality of penalties, timeliness of case processing, and
delivery of victim services.
Specifically, the task force recommended (1) uniform collection of data disaggregated by
race/ethnicity, gender, and severity (felony or misdemeanor) to enable identification of disparities
and inequities at defined decision points and (2) establishment of a fund to provide grants to
counties to defray CMS development costs. Specifically, the task force called for the following
data to be captured by a CMS uniformly across the State:
 charges at arrest;
 filed charges;
 final disposition of all charges;
 whether a plea offer was made;
 if the case was dismissed, the reason for the dismissal;
 if the case was declined, the reason for the declination;
 dates for the decision points listed above;
 the referring law enforcement agency;
 the assigned prosecutor(s);
 defendant characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, gender, zip code); and
 victim characteristics (e.g., race/ethnicity, age, gender, zip code).
Authorization for the task force ended June 30, 2024.

Impacts of the Bill on Equity Research
Prosecutorial discretion can significantly contribute to disparities at various decision points in the
criminal justice process. Prosecutors make decisions about who to charge, what charges to file,
and how to plea bargain. In some cases, these decisions can lead to unequal outcomes based on
factors like race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status, even for similar crimes. Data collection and
transparency are key to measuring disparities in this regard. The CMS contemplated by the bill
would establish the needed data infrastructure to begin to identify and measure the equity
implications of decision making by prosecutors throughout the State.
Conclusion
The bill’s establishment of a CMS grant fund will benefit equity-related research in the years ahead
to the extent that State’s Attorneys develop a CMS and the data collected is made available for
public policy decision making. The magnitude of any beneficial equity impacts will partly be
determined by the task force’s specific recommendations on data collection and transparency. The
bill has the potential to enhance the public’s understanding of how prosecutorial discretion is
applied in key criminal justice decisions.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
