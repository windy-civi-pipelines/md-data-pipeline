Section 1:
2025 Session
SB0398
Criminal Procedure - Automated Expungement
This bill requires the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) and the
Judiciary to “expunge” specified cases by July 1, 2027, and expunge cases meeting other specified
criteria on a monthly basis beginning August 1, 2027.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s broad automatic expungement provisions will increase overall expungements and negate
the need for individuals to file a petition for expungement. This will be impactful to individuals in
obtaining employment and other related benefits. National and State data show significant negative
effects of a criminal record on employment outcomes, and while data is not available to measure
the specific extent of these impacts, Black individuals could benefit the most from the bill as they
are significantly overrepresented in the criminal justice system.
Analysis
The bill requires that, by July 1, 2027, DPSCS and the Judiciary remove from public view all
electronic court records related to (1) cases eligible for expungement under § 10-105 of the
Criminal Procedure Article if at least three years have passed since the disposition of the case or
(2) cases eligible for expungement under § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article, if at least
seven years have passed since disposition of the case and the charge is a misdemeanor other than
a domestically related crime under § 6-233 of the Criminal Procedure Article or second-degree
assault. The bill also establishes a monthly ongoing automated expungement process for the
specified misdemeanors and felonies beginning August 1, 2027. Cases must be expunged by the
Judiciary and DPSCS within 30 days after notification of newfound eligibility. Other provisions
in the bill outline the administrative procedures for automatic expungement.
SB 398/ Page 1
Under the bill, “expunge” means to remove all references to a specified case from the Central
Repository and remove from public view all electronic court records relating to the case.
Expungement does not require physical obliteration of records or redaction of physical or
electronic documents, media, or recordings.
Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Record
Expungement is intended to help mitigate the adverse consequences of having a criminal record,
which can last beyond imprisonment, fines, and the legal process and can include the denial of
civil opportunities and benefits available to a person due to their record. Specifically, having a
criminal history can adversely affect employment prospects which can further influence an
individual’s level of income, housing opportunities, and access to quality health care. Employment
is key to stable housing and homeownership, and a variety of State and national data show that
higher incomes can lead to the stability and consistency necessary to accumulate the various
upfront resources needed to buy a home. Monetary savings for down payments and good credit
scores are necessary to achieve initial homeownership and are largely driven by an individual’s
employment status and level of income. Employment also often dictates one’s access to health
care. Certain jobs do not offer health insurance benefits and access to jobs with such benefits may
be restricted by an attachment to a criminal record. A criminal record can therefore impose
significant barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility.
Impacts of the Bill
According to the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), there were 46,251 petitions for
expungement in Maryland’s circuit courts and District Court in fiscal 2023 and 54,069 petitions in
fiscal 2024. There is currently no demographic data available that indicates the racial and ethnic
composition of individuals impacted by expungement. However, assuming trends for
expungement applications mimic trends for charges, convictions, and incarceration in the State,
there would be both a significant number and percentage of Black individuals who would benefit
under the bill. Representing a disproportionate share of the charged, arrested, convicted, and
incarcerated population, it is a reasonable assumption that Black individuals comprise a
meaningful portion of the population with expungement eligible records.
National and State data consistently show that racial minorities experience disproportionate levels
of adversity in the areas of life affected by a criminal record. National studies have found that there
is a significant negative effect of having a criminal record on employment outcomes that appears
substantially larger for Black individuals. As shown in Exhibit 1, in 2023, the unemployment rate
in Maryland was highest among Black job seekers and nearly twice the rate of white job seekers
in the State.

The provisions of the bill will likely impact Black individuals to a greater extent as these
individuals are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates in Maryland. DPSCS reports that, for
fiscal 2024, Black individuals made up 72% of Maryland’s prison population contrasted with their
29% share of the State’s overall population.
Conclusion
The bill’s provisions will generally encourage all the ancillary benefits and opportunities that come
with expunged court records, such as increased access to employment, housing, and health care
opportunities and may impact Black individuals to a greater extent given the disproportionate
number of Black individuals arrested, charged, and convicted in the State’s criminal justice system.
The magnitude of the impact is likely to be significant given the automated nature of the
expungements, but ultimately final eligibility depends on the determinations of judges. Specific
equity impacts cannot be estimated without additional historical demographic data on
expungement applicants, the number of eligible offenses for expungement under the bill, and
prospective employment data for individuals with expunged records.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
