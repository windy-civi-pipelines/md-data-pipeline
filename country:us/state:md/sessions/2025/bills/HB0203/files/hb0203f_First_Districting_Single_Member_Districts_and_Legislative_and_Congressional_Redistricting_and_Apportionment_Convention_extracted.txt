18 office. Five of the justices shall constitute a quorum, and five justices shall sit in each case
19 unless the Supreme Court of Maryland shall direct that an additional justice or justices sit
20 for any case. The concurrence of a majority of those sitting shall be sufficient for the decision
21 of any cause, and an equal division of those sitting in a case has the effect of affirming the
22 decision appealed from if there is no application for reargument as hereinafter provided. In
23 any case where there is an equal division or a three to two division of the Supreme Court
24 of Maryland a reargument before the full Court of seven justices shall be granted to the
