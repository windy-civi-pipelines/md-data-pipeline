22 HOUSE BILL 218
1 (2) (i) There is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child
2 support which would result from the application of the child support guidelines set forth in
3 this subtitle is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.
4 (ii) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the
5 application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.
6 (iii) In determining whether the application of the guidelines would
7 be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court may consider:
8 1. the terms of any existing separation or property
9 settlement agreement or court order, including:

23 poverty [level] GUIDELINES for an individual (LESS THAN $1,145).
24 (iv) [The presumption may not be rebutted solely on the basis of

26 parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly
27 contributing.
28 (v)] 1. If the court determines that the application of the
29 guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court shall make a
30 written finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the
31 guidelines.
32 2. The court’s finding shall state:
HOUSE BILL 218 23
1 A. the amount of child support that would have been required
2 under the guidelines;
3 B. how the order varies from the guidelines;
4 C. how the finding serves the best interests of the child WHO
5 IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ORDER; and
6 D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a
7 portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items
8 conveyed.
9 12–204.
10 (a) (1) The basic child support obligation shall be determined in accordance
11 with the schedule of basic child support obligations in subsection (e) of this section. The

13 adjusted actual incomes.

15 maintenance in the proceeding in which a child support award is sought, the court shall
16 decide the issue and amount of alimony or maintenance before determining the child
17 support obligation under these guidelines.

19 alimony or maintenance awarded shall be considered actual income for the recipient of the
20 alimony or maintenance and shall be subtracted from the income of the payor of the alimony
21 or maintenance under [§ 12–201(c)(2)] § 12–201(C)(1)(II) of this subtitle before the court
22 determines the amount of a child support award.
23 (3) THE AMOUNT OF THE DEDUCTION FOR THE SUPPORT OF
24 ADDITIONAL CHILDREN LIVING IN A PARENT’S HOME UNDER §
25 12–201(C)(1)(III) OF THIS SUBTITLE SHALL BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE PARENT’S

20 alimony or maintenance and shall be subtracted from the income of the payor of the alimony
21 or maintenance under [§ 12–201(c)(2)] § 12–201(C)(1)(II) of this subtitle before the court
