6 (e) (1) Any printed deed or other instrument offered for recordation shall be
7 printed in not less than eight–point type and in black letters and be on white paper of

27 official having responsibility for the certification or authentication of recorded documents
28 in the jurisdiction where the document is recorded; and
29 (ii) An indication of the recording reference and court or other public
30 registry where the original document is recorded.
