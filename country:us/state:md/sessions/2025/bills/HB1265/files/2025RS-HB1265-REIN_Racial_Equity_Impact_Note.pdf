2025 Session
HB1265
Juveniles - Arrests for Reportable Offenses
Bill Summary
This emergency departmental bill alters the notification and data sharing provisions related to a
student’s arrest for a reportable offense or an offense related to the student’s membership in a
criminal organization. The Department of Juvenile Services (DJS) and the Maryland State
Department of Education (MSDE), in consultation with specified entities, must develop an
operational protocol to guide the transmission of information about students’ arrests (and
subsequent dispositions) for reportable offenses and offenses related to membership in a criminal
organization.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s provisions alter the officials that the State’s Attorney must notify of a case disposition
after a student’s arrest for a reportable offense. To the extent that these provisions hasten
notifications of favorable dispositions, the bill would ensure the prompt return to regular in-school
programming for students in cases where they were removed from in-person learning or otherwise
disciplined following an arrest. Black students are most likely to benefit from the provisions of the
bill as they are overrepresented in reportable offense arrests and school suspensions and
expulsions. The public safety impacts of the bill, while not measured, would be beneficial as the
increased information sharing would allow school officials to work to ensure the physical safety
of students while maintaining the privacy of arrested juveniles.
Analysis
The bill’s provisions would require a State’s Attorney to notify the following school officials of
the disposition of a student’s charges resulting from an arrest for a reportable offense: (1) the local
superintendent; (2) the school principal; and (3) the school security officer if one is assigned.
HB 1265/ Page 1

Existing law requires the State’s Attorney to not ify either the school principal or superintendent.
If the student’s disposition is that of a delinquent adjudication, or if their charges are still pending,
the bill requires that the local superintendent, school principal, and specified officials in DJS,
where applicable, notify by confidential file specified personnel of another school in the State to
which the student has transferred or enrolled. The bill also requires DJS and MSDE to develop an
operational protocol for transmission of the confidential files between schools.
Reportable Offenses Generally
Under existing law, a reportable offense is an offense that (1) occurred off school premises; (2) did
not occur at an event sponsored by the school; and (3) includes a crime of violence, as specified in
current law, and numerous other specified weapons, drugs, assault, and theft-related offenses.
When a student is arrested for a reportable offense or an offense related to the student’s
membership in a criminal organization, the law enforcement agency making the arrest must notify
(1) the local superintendent; (2) the school principal; and (3) if appropriate, the school security
officer. The law enforcement agency may also notify the State’s Attorney.
In 2022, the General Assembly expressed concern about the purported misuse or overuse of school
removals for students arrested for a reportable offense. Chapter 742 of 2022 clarifies that a
“reportable offense” as it relates to students in public or nonpublic schools is an offense that
occurred off school premises and did not occur at an event sponsored by the school. The Act also
requires that students accused of reportable offenses be disciplined according to existing State
regulations and provides for additional due process accommodations by allowing a student accused
of a reportable offense to have an attorney attend the conference between the student or parent and
principal or county superintendent.
Juvenile Intake Process
The intake process for juveniles accused of any criminal offense requires a determination as to
whether the juvenile court has jurisdiction and whether judicial action is in the best interest of the
public and/or the child. DJS intake officers are authorized to (1) disapprove a complaint as legally
insufficient; (2) resolve the matter at intake with or without services; (3) propose an informal
adjustment period (also called pre-court supervision); or (4) authorize the filing of a petition by
the State’s Attorney’s Office. While DJS can informally handle all complaints, violent felonies
and handgun violations must be reviewed by the State’s Attorney and approved for informal
adjustment/pre-court supervision. Informal adjustments serve to divert youth from formal juvenile
court processing.
Impacts of the Bill
MSDE reported 986 reportable offense incidents during the 2022-2023 school year. Of these
incidents, 65% involved Black students, 18% were white, 9% were Hispanic, and 6% involved
students of two or more races. Asian, American Indian or Alaskan Natives, and Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders accounted for less than 2% of the total. Exhibit 1 shows the racial and
ethnic breakdowns for reportable offenses compared to each group’s share of the State’s public
school population during the same time period.

In addition, MSDE 2022-2023 school year data shows that there were 69,274 suspensions and/or
expulsions for major offenses, several of which would be considered a reportable offense requiring
notification of specified school officials under current law. Black students comprised 33% of the
overall school enrollment but accounted for 58% of all suspensions and expulsions compared to
their white counterparts that accounted for 21% of suspensions and expulsions and 33% of school
enrollment.
While not measured here, the bill will generally enhance the public safety environment in schools
due to its information sharing component. Racial equity concerns exist for victims or potential
victims of crimes, and the increased notifications provided by the bill will alert school officials to
youth that may pose a danger to other students.
Conclusion
The bill’s requirement for a State’s Attorney to notify school officials of post-arrest outcomes for
reportable offense arrests would benefit the affected students by allowing a faster return to regular
school programming in those cases where an arrested student is not referred to formal proceedings.
Black students in particular may be impacted to the greatest extent as they make up a large portion
of reportable offense arrests as well as out of school suspensions and expulsions in general. In the
HB 1265/ Page 3

instance where an arrested student is subject to intake by DJS and potentially adjudicated
delinquent, the bill would provide school officials with notification of the student’s disposition
and allow for disciplinary and/or alternative educational actions they deem appropriate through an
established protocol. The specific impacts of the bill cannot be determined without additional
longitudinal data on arrest outcomes, State’s Attorney notifications, and detailed suspension and
expulsion data.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
