17 the obligations of the State under Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution, or the
18 provisions made by the laws of the State for the establishment and maintenance of a system
19 of public schools or the payment of any salaries required to be paid by the State of Maryland
20 by the Constitution.
21 (6a) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill each fiscal year as required under this
22 Section, the General Assembly may amend the bill by increasing or diminishing the items
23 therein relating to the General Assembly, and by increasing or diminishing the items
24 therein relating to the judiciary, but except as hereinbefore specified, may not alter the bill
25 except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary or
26 compensation of any public officer may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of
27 office. When passed by both Houses, the Budget Bill shall be presented to the Governor for
28 approval or disapproval according to Section 17 of Article II of this Constitution.
29 (6b) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill as required under this Section for fiscal
30 year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Assembly may amend the bill by
31 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the General Assembly, by
32 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the judiciary, and by
33 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the Executive Department,
34 provided that the total of the appropriation for the Executive Department approved by the
35 General Assembly does not exceed the total proposed appropriation for the Executive
36 Department submitted by the Governor. The salary or compensation of any public officer
37 may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of office. When passed by both Houses,
38 the Budget Bill shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.
39 (7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments, boards,
40 officers and commissions of the State expending or applying for State’s moneys, as have
41 been designated by the Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when requested
42 by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be heard with
HOUSE BILL 159 15
1 respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer inquiries relative
2 thereto.
3 (8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
4 appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
5 the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other
6 appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the provisions following: (a) Every
7 such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
8 or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
9 Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
10 appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
11 be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless
12 it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
13 elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
14 Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
15 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
16 apply.
17 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General Assembly
18 from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of Article 3 of the
19 Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in Section 17 of
20 Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment of any
21 obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the Constitution of
22 the United States.
23 (10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the Legislature
24 seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue a
25 proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
26 judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
27 be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
28 (11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require from the
29 proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and administrative
30 offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise the
31 expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
32 itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
33 the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
34 effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
35 the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
36 in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
37 of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
38 Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
39 transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
40 and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
41 (12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
42 require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all
16 HOUSE BILL 159
1 institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
2 the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary
3 departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
4 may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
5 which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
6 before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
7 (13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
8 inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
9 (14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this Section
10 and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section shall
11 prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of Article
12 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance thereof, or
13 be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of the General
14 Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General Assembly at
15 such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
16 appropriations.
17 (15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this
18 Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
19 of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.
20 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Assembly
21 determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
22 Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland
23 Constitution concerning local approval of constitutional amendments do not apply.
24 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:
25 (a) The amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
26 Act shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State at the next general election to be
27 held in November 2026 for adoption or rejection pursuant to Article XIV of the Maryland
28 Constitution.

30 Constitution shall be by ballot, and on each ballot there shall be printed the words “For the

34 following shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State:
35 “Question ___ – Constitutional Amendment
36 Providing that each budget shall include expenditures necessary to implement wages,
37 hours, fringe benefits, health benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for
HOUSE BILL 159 17
1 State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding covering State

3 (c) Immediately after the election, all returns shall be made to the Governor of
4 the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
5 Maryland Constitution, and further proceedings had in accordance with Article XIV.
6 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That, except as provided in Section
7 4 of this Act, this Act shall take effect July 1, 2025.

9 contingent on the passage of Section 2 of this Act, a constitutional amendment, and its

7 shall contain a complete plan of proposed expenditures and estimated revenues for said
8 fiscal year and shall show the estimated surplus or deficit of revenues at the end of the
9 preceding fiscal year. EACH BUDGET SHALL ALSO CONTAIN THE APPROPRIATIONS

41 detail as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law; and the presiding
42 officer of each House shall promptly cause said bill to be introduced therein, and such bill

4 presiding officers of both Houses; and such amendment or supplement shall thereby become
5 a part of said Budget Bill as an addition to the items of said bill or as a modification of or a
6 substitute for any item of said bill such amendment or supplement may affect.
7 (5a) The Budget and the Budget Bill as submitted by the Governor to the General
8 Assembly shall have a figure for the total of all proposed appropriations and a figure for
9 the total of all estimated revenues available to pay the appropriations, and the figure for
10 total proposed appropriations shall not exceed the figure for total estimated revenues.
11 Neither the Governor in submitting an amendment or supplement to the Budget Bill nor
12 the General Assembly in amending the Budget Bill shall thereby cause the figure for total
13 proposed appropriations to exceed the figure for total estimated revenues, including any
14 revisions, and in the Budget Bill as enacted the figure for total estimated revenues always
15 shall be equal to or exceed the figure for total appropriations.
16 (6) The General Assembly shall not amend the Budget Bill so as to affect either
17 the obligations of the State under Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution, or the
18 provisions made by the laws of the State for the establishment and maintenance of a system
19 of public schools or the payment of any salaries required to be paid by the State of Maryland

22 Section, the General Assembly may amend the bill by increasing or diminishing the items
23 therein relating to the General Assembly, and by increasing or diminishing the items
24 therein relating to the judiciary, but except as hereinbefore specified, may not alter the bill
25 except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary or
26 compensation of any public officer may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of
27 office. When passed by both Houses, the Budget Bill shall be presented to the Governor for
28 approval or disapproval according to Section 17 of Article II of this Constitution.

30 year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Assembly may amend the bill by
31 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the General Assembly, by
32 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the judiciary, and by
33 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the Executive Department,
34 provided that the total of the appropriation for the Executive Department approved by the
35 General Assembly does not exceed the total proposed appropriation for the Executive
36 Department submitted by the Governor. The salary or compensation of any public officer
37 may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of office. When passed by both Houses,
38 the Budget Bill shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.
39 (7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments, boards,
40 officers and commissions of the State expending or applying for State’s moneys, as have
41 been designated by the Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when requested
42 by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be heard with

HOUSE BILL 159 15
1 respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer inquiries relative
2 thereto.
3 (8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
4 appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
5 the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other
6 appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the provisions following: (a) Every
7 such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
8 or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
9 Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
10 appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
11 be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless
12 it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
13 elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
14 Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
15 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
16 apply.
17 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General Assembly
18 from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of Article 3 of the
19 Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in Section 17 of
20 Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment of any
21 obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the Constitution of
22 the United States.
23 (10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the Legislature
24 seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue a
25 proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
26 judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
27 be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
28 (11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require from the
29 proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and administrative
30 offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise the
31 expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
32 itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
33 the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
34 effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
35 the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
36 in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
37 of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
38 Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
39 transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
40 and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
41 (12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
42 require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all

16 HOUSE BILL 159
1 institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
2 the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary
3 departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
4 may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
5 which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
6 before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
7 (13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
8 inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
9 (14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this Section
10 and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section shall
11 prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of Article
12 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance thereof, or
13 be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of the General
14 Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General Assembly at
15 such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
16 appropriations.
17 (15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this
18 Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
19 of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.
20 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Assembly
21 determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
22 Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland
23 Constitution concerning local approval of constitutional amendments do not apply.

HOUSE BILL 159 17
1 State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding covering State

4 the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
5 Maryland Constitution, and further proceedings had in accordance with Article XIV.
