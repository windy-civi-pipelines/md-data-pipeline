SENATE BILL 333 5
1 (v) the timing of the statement;
2 (vi) whether the child victim’s or witness’s young age makes it
3 unlikely that the child victim or witness fabricated the statement that represents a graphic,

6 child victim’s or witness’s age;

28 State has been unable to procure the child victim’s or witness’s presence by subpoena or
29 other reasonable means; or
6 SENATE BILL 333
1 (ii) the court determines that an audio or visual recording of the
2 child victim’s or witness’s statement makes an examination of the child victim or witness
3 unnecessary.
4 (2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, any defendant
5 or child respondent, attorney for a defendant or child respondent, and the prosecuting
6 attorney may be present when the court hears testimony on whether to admit into evidence
7 the out of court statement of a child victim or witness under this section.
8 (3) When the court examines the child victim or witness as paragraph (1)
9 of this subsection requires:
