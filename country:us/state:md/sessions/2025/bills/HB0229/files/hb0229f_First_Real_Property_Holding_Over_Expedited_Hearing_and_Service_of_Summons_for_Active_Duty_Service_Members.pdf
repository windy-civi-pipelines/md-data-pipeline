2 HOUSE BILL 229
1 (3) (i) Any action to recover damages under this section may be brought
2 by suit separate from the eviction or removal proceeding or in the same action and in any
3 court having jurisdiction over the amount in issue.
4 (ii) The court may also give judgment in favor of the landlord for the
5 damages determined to be due together with costs of the suit if the court finds that the
6 residential tenant was personally served with a summons, or, in the case of a nonresidential
7 tenancy, there was such service of process or submission to the jurisdiction of the court as
8 would support a judgment in contract or tort.
9 (iii) A nonresidential tenant who was not personally served with a
10 summons shall not be subject to personal jurisdiction of the court if that tenant asserts that
11 the appearance is for the purpose of defending an in rem action prior to the time that
12 evidence is taken by the court.
13 (4) Nothing [contained herein] IN THIS SECTION is intended to limit any
14 other remedies which a landlord may have against a holdover tenant under the lease or
15 under applicable law.
16 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for
17 any definite term or at will, and the landlord shall desire to repossess the property after
18 the expiration of the term for which it was leased and shall give notice as required under
19 subsection (c) of this section to the tenant or to the person actually in possession of the
20 property to remove from the property at the end of the term, and if the tenant or person in
21 actual possession shall refuse to comply, the landlord may make complaint in writing to
22 the District Court of the county where the property is located.
23 (ii) SUBJECT TO SUBPARAGRAPH (III) OF THIS PARAGRAPH:
24 1. The court shall issue a summons directed to any constable

27 court to show cause why restitution should not be made to the landlord[.];
28 2. The constable or sheriff shall serve the summons on the
29 tenant, assignee, or subtenant on the property, or on the known or authorized agent of the
30 tenant, assignee, or subtenant[.];
31 3. If, for any reason [those persons] THE TENANT,
32 ASSIGNEE, OR SUBTENANT ON THE PROPERTY OR THE KNOWN OR AUTHORIZED
33 AGENT OF THE TENANT, ASSIGNEE, OR SUBTENANT cannot be found, the constable or
34 sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons conspicuously on the property[.]; AND

HOUSE BILL 229 3
1 4. After notice to the tenant, assignee, or subtenant by
2 first–class mail, the affixing of the summons on the property shall be conclusively presumed
3 to be a sufficient service to support restitution.

5 LANDLORD OR THE LANDLORD’S SPOUSE:
6 A. IS ON ACTIVE DUTY WITH THE UNITED STATES
7 MILITARY;
8 B. HAS RELOCATED TO THE STATE AS A DIRECT RESULT

18 45 DAYS AFTER THE DATE THE LANDLORD MAKES A COMPLAINT UNDER THIS
19 SECTION TO REPOSSESS THE PROPERTY.
20 3. IF THE CONSTABLE OR SHERIFF OF THE COUNTY
21 FAILS TO SERVE THE SUMMONS REQUIRED UNDER SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF THIS
22 PARAGRAPH WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER THE SUMMONS IS ISSUED BY THE COURT, THE
23 SUMMONS MAY BE SERVED BY A PRIVATE PROCESS SERVER.
24 [(iii)] (IV) Upon the failure of either of the parties to appear before
25 the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not
26 less than 6 nor more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the parties of the
27 continuance.
28 (2) (i) If upon hearing the parties, or in case the tenant or person in
29 possession shall neglect to appear after the summons and continuance the court shall find
30 that the landlord had been in possession of the leased property, that the said tenancy is
31 fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant
32 or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,
33 the court shall thereupon give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said
34 premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective
35 counties commanding the tenant or person in possession forthwith to deliver to the landlord
36 possession thereof in as full and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same

4 HOUSE BILL 229

7 securities conditioned that the tenant will prosecute the appeal with effect and well and
8 truly pay all rent in arrears and all costs in the case before the District Court and in the
9 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
10 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall
11 so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
12 thereof until the determination of said appeal.

14 day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 nor more than 15 days after the

4 the landlord’s agent or representatives, at least 30 days before the expiration of the lease
5 or tenancy in all cases except in cases of tenancies from year to year, and at least 90 days’
6 notice in all cases of tenancy from year to year (except in all cases of farm tenancy, the

8 and to surrender possession of the property at that time, and the landlord, the landlord’s
9 agent, or representative shall prove the notice from the tenant by competent testimony, it
10 shall not be necessary for the landlord, the landlord’s agent or representative to provide a
11 written notice to the tenant, but the proof of such notice from the tenant as aforesaid shall
12 entitle the landlord to recover possession of the property hereunder.

23 1. At least 30 days before the expiration of the lease in cases

25 2. At least 60 days before the expiration of the lease in cases
26 of tenancies from year to year.
27 (5) (i) Acceptance of any payment after notice but before eviction shall
28 not operate as a waiver of any notice to quit, notice of intent to vacate or any judgment for
29 possession unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
30 (ii) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
31 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of

6 HOUSE BILL 229

4 (d) Unless stated otherwise in the written lease and initialed by the tenant, when
5 a landlord consents to a holdover tenant remaining on the premises, the holdover tenant
