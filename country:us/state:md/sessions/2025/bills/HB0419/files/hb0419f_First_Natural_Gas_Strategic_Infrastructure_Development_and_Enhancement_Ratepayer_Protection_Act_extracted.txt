18 take final action on a plan within the time period required under subsection (e) of this
19 section, the gas company may implement the plan.

8 section.
9 (h) Each year a gas company shall file with the Commission a reconciliation to
10 adjust the amount of a surcharge to account for any difference between the actual cost of a
11 plan and the actual amount recovered under the surcharge.
