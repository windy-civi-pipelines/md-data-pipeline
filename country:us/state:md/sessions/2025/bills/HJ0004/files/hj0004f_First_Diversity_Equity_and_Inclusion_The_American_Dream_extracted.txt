2 HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 4
1 WHEREAS, DEI policies, from the 19th Amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964
2 to the Americans with Disabilities Act, among others, reflect the corrective legislative and
3 legal actions taken across our nation’s history to expand and guarantee access to the
4 educational, economic, and civic obligations and capacities of our nation; and
5 WHEREAS, DEI principles and policies promote equal access to opportunities, foster
6 an environment of respect and belonging, and ensure that every individual – regardless of
7 background – can fully participate in all aspects of society; and
8 WHEREAS, DEI is essential to creating a society where all individuals are valued,
9 heard, and included; and
10 WHEREAS, DEI is based on removing barriers to opportunity so that our merits can
11 speak for themselves; and
12 WHEREAS, DEI is committed to widening pathways to the American Dream for
13 every community so that all people can reap the benefits of shared prosperity in our nation;
14 and
15 WHEREAS, Freedom of speech and expression are fundamental constitutional
16 rights, protecting the ability of individuals to voice their ideas and opinions without
17 interference, punishment, or retaliation by the government; and
18 WHEREAS, Anti–DEI activists, politicians, and corporate decision–makers who
19 attempt to prohibit DEI infringe upon the right of individuals to freely express themselves,
20 diminish the diversity of perspectives that strengthen our society, and conflict with
21 antidiscrimination laws; and
22 WHEREAS, Efforts to attack DEI are harmful to the bottom line and health of our
23 economy; now, therefore, be it
24 RESOLVED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND, That Maryland
