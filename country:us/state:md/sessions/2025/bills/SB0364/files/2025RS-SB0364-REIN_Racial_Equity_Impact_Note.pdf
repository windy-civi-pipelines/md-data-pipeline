2025 Session
SB0364
Criminal Law - Manslaughter by Vehicle or Vessel - Increased
Penalties (Jamari's Law)
Bill Summary
This bill increases the maximum incarceration penalties for manslaughter by vehicle or vessel
(gross negligence) from 10 years to 20 years for a first conviction and from 15 years to 30 years
for a subsequent conviction.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill increases the maximum incarceration penalties for manslaughter by vehicle or vessel
(gross negligence) for both first-time and repeat offenders. Although there are existing racial
disparities in Maryland’s criminal justice system, the penalty increases proposed by the bill are not
likely to exacerbate these disparities due to the low number of individuals convicted and
incarcerated for this offense.
Analysis
This bill increases the maximum incarceration penalties for manslaughter by vehicle or vessel
(gross negligence) from 10 years to 20 years for a first conviction and from 15 years to 30 years
for a subsequent conviction. The monetary penalties are not affected by the bill.
Under existing law, manslaughter by vehicle or vessel (gross negligence) is a felony, generally
punishable by imprisonment for up to 10 years and/or a fine of up to $5,000. However, a maximum
penalty of imprisonment for up to 15 years and/or a fine of up to $10,000 applies to a person who
has previously been convicted of manslaughter by vehicle or vessel (gross negligence);
manslaughter by vehicle or vessel (criminal negligence); homicide by motor vehicle or vessel

while under the influence or impaired by alcoh ol, drugs, or a controlled dangerous substance
(CDS); life-threatening injury by motor vehicle or vessel while under the influence or impaired by
alcohol, drugs, or a CDS; or drunk or drugged driving under § 21-902 of the Transportation Article.
Gross Negligence
The standard of “gross negligence” is established in common law and requires that evidence show,
beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offender had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life in
the operation of an automobile. The conduct must be extraordinary or outrageous to meet this
standard.
The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services advises that, during fiscal 2024, it
received 23 incarcerated individuals with a total of 26 convictions for manslaughter by vehicle or
vessel (gross negligence). The data did not clearly distinguish between first-time and subsequent
offenders. The average sentence length for the 26 convictions was 5.7 years.
The Maryland State Commission on Criminal Sentencing Policy (MSCCSP) advises that it
received information on 29 individuals sentenced to 42 counts for a first-time commission of
manslaughter by vehicle or vessel (gross negligence) in the circuit courts during fiscal 2024.
According to MSCCSP, another 6 individuals were sentenced to 6 counts for a second or
subsequent commission of this offense. The Judiciary advises that, in fiscal 2024, there were
14 violations (charges) and 0 guilty dispositions (convictions) for manslaughter by vehicle or
vessel (gross negligence) in the District Court. In fiscal 2023, there were 17 violations and 0 guilty
dispositions. The District Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the circuit courts over this offense.
Conclusion
The bill increases penalties for the felony of manslaughter by vehicle or vessel (gross negligence).
The bill’s impact is likely to be minimal due to the low number of individuals convicted of or
incarcerated for this offense. In addition, the bill’s penalty increases are not mandatory in nature,
making any meaningful impact unlikely.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
