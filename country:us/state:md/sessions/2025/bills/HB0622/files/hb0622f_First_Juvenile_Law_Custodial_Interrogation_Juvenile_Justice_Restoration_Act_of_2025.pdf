6 (2) The law enforcement officer has made an effort reasonably calculated
7 to give actual notice to the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child that the child will be
8 interrogated.
9 (c) A consultation with an attorney under this section:
10 (1) Shall be:
11 (i) Conducted in a manner consistent with the Maryland Rules of

23 under this subtitle or is charged as an adult.
24 (f) (1) A law enforcement agency conducting an interrogation under this
25 section shall maintain a record of the notification or attempted notification of a parent,
26 guardian, or custodian under this section, including:
27 (i) A signed statement by a duly authorized law enforcement officer
28 employed by the agency that an attempt to notify a parent, guardian, or custodian was

HOUSE BILL 622 3
1 (ii) The name of the person sought to be notified; and

8 the record required to be maintained under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph.
9 (g) (1) Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a law enforcement
10 officer may conduct an otherwise lawful custodial interrogation of a child if:
11 (i) 1. The law enforcement officer reasonably believes that the
12 information sought is necessary to protect against a threat to public safety; and
13 [(ii)] 2. The questions posed to the child by the law enforcement
14 officer are limited to those questions reasonably necessary to obtain the information
15 necessary to protect against the threat to public safety; OR
