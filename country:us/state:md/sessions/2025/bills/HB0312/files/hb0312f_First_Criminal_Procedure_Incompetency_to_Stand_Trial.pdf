1 OF THE EXPIRATION OF 10 YEARS OR THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR THE MOST
2 SERIOUS OFFENSE CHARGED;
3 (2) when charged with a felony or a crime of violence as defined under §

5 SUBSECTION, after the lesser of the expiration of 5 years or the maximum sentence for the
6 most serious offense charged; or

19 (2) the Criminal Justice Information System Central Repository.
