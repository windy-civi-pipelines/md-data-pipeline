2025 Session
HB0777
Criminal Procedure - Expungement - Effect
Bill Summary
This bill establishes that a person granted an expungement under Title 10, Subtitle 1 of the
Criminal Procedure Article must be determined for all purposes not to have been arrested for, cited
for, charged with, or convicted of the underlying offense.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s provisions require that for expungement records, even though law enforcement or the
courts may have access to records detailing an individual’s criminal or court history, it is deemed
that the expunged offense did not occur. The bill would provide that individuals with expunged
records will not be obligated to disclose these offenses. Expungement can be helpful to impacted
individuals in obtaining employment and other related benefits. National data shows significant
negative effects of a criminal record on employment outcomes, and these negative effects appear
to be substantially larger for Black individuals. Accordingly, the bill will likely impact Black
individuals with an expunged criminal record to the greatest extent. Additional data would be
required to measure the overall equity impacts.
Analysis
This bill requires that, for all purposes after an individual has been granted an expungement of
criminal and court records, the expungement must be treated as if the individual had not been
arrested for, cited for, charged with, or convicted of the underlying offense. The bill does not alter
the statutorily defined instances where an individual may petition for expungement, nor does it
affect the recordkeeping or other maintenance of any State or local agency or of law enforcement.
The practical effect of the bill is that its changes will allow a person to declare on applications,
HB 777/ Page 1

employment documents, and other forms that the y were not arrested or charged for an expunged
offense without concern of being accused of making a false statement.
Expungements Generally
Other than specified court-initiated expungements under § 10-105.1 of the Criminal Procedure
Article, to begin the process of expungement, a petitioner must file a petition for expungement
with the court under § 10-105 or § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article, which establishes
eligibility for the expungement of records pertaining to a criminal charge or conviction. With some
exceptions, § 10-105 applies to dispositions other than a conviction, and § 10-110 applies to
expungements of convictions. Expungement of a court or police record means removal from public
inspection:
 by obliteration;
 by removal to a separate secure area to which persons who do not have a legitimate reason
for access are denied access; or
 if access to a court record or police record can be obtained only by reference to another
such record, by the expungement of that record, or the part of it that provides access.
According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, there were 46,251 petitions for expungement
in fiscal 2023 and 54,069 petitions for expungement in fiscal 2024 in both the district and circuit
courts. There is no demographic data available that indicates the racial and ethnic composition of
individuals impacted by expungement.
Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Record
Expungement is intended to help mitigate the adverse consequences of having a criminal record,
which can last beyond imprisonment, fines, and the legal process and can include the removal of
civil opportunities, such as in the application to receive a license to carry a firearm and benefits
available to a person due to their record. As a result, a criminal record can impede a person’s ability
to successfully reenter society. Specifically, having a criminal history can adversely affect
employment prospects which can further influence an individual’s level of income, housing
opportunities, and access to quality health care.
Employment is key to stable housing and homeownership and a variety of State and national data
show that higher incomes can lead to the stability and consistency necessary to accumulate the
various upfront resources needed to buy a home. Monetary savings for down payments and good
credit scores are necessary to achieve initial homeownership and are largely driven by one’s
employment status and level of income. Employment also often dictates one’s access to health
care. Certain jobs do not offer health insurance benefits and access to jobs with such benefits may
be restricted by an attachment to a criminal record. A criminal record can therefore impose
significant barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility following societal reentry and even
contribute to recidivism.

Impacts of the Bill
National and State data consistently show that racial minorities experience disproportionate levels
of adversity in the areas of life affected by a criminal record. National studies have found that there
is a significant negative effect of having a criminal record on employment outcomes that appears
substantially larger for Black individuals. As shown in Exhibit 1, in 2023, the unemployment rate
in Maryland was highest among Black job seekers and almost twice the rate of white job seekers
in the State.
The bill’s expungement rules will likely impact Black individuals to a greater extent as Maryland
incarcerates these individuals at a disproportionately high rate. The Department of Public Safety
and Correctional Services reports that as of January 2025, Black inmates made up 72% of
Maryland’s prison population contrasted with their 29% share of the State’s overall population.

Conclusion
The bill’s provisions would make expungement of criminal and other court or law enforcement
records more complete and final. This will enable successful applicants for expungement to refrain
from disclosing certain convictions and contacts that may prevent them from achieving
employment and all the ancillary benefits and opportunities that come with it, such as licensure
applications, adequate housing, and health care opportunities. The bill will potentially impact

Black individuals to a greater extent given thei r disproportionate incarceration rate. The exact
equity impacts of the bill cannot be estimated, however, without additional data including
historical demographic data on expungement applicants and prospective employment data for
individuals with expunged records.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest single race
demographic group in the State of Maryland comprising 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national population, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black
or African American, with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black or African
American and another 2.5% identifying as Black in combination with some other race. Maryland’s
Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher than the Asian share of the national population of
6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity, however, is slightly less diverse than the
U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19%
of the U.S. population.
