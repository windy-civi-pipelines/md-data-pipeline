Section 1:
2025 Session
HB0318
Order to Report to Confinement
Bill Summary
This bill expands § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article to authorize a person to file a petition
for expungement of a conviction under § 9-405(a)(2) of the Criminal Law Article for escape in the
second degree – failure to obey a court order to report to a place of confinement.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
Those eligible under the bill for expungement of a second-degree escape conviction for failure to
obey a court order to report to a place of confinement would benefit to the extent that expungement
may help reduce the effects of collateral consequences of a criminal record. A detailed impact
analysis cannot be performed without demographic data of those convicted of the violations
outlined in the bill. Black individuals, however, may see the largest impact due to their
disproportionate representation in the State’s criminal justice system, but the overall impact is
likely minimal due to the relatively small number of individuals convicted for this offense.
Analysis
A person is prohibited from knowingly failing to obey a court order to report to a place of
confinement under § 9-405(a)(2) of the Criminal Law Article. “Place of confinement” means a
correctional facility, a facility of the Maryland Department of Health, or any other facility in which
a person is confined under color of law, including home detention. It does not include a juvenile
detention center or other specified juvenile facilities. Also known as escape in the second degree,
violators are guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for up to three years and/or a
HB 318/ Page 1
maximum fine of $5,000. The bill allows an ind ividual to file a petition for expungement of a
conviction for this offense.
Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Record
Expungement is intended to help mitigate the adverse consequences of having a criminal record,
which can last beyond imprisonment, fines, and the legal process and can include the denial of
civil opportunities and benefits available to a person due to their record. Specifically, having a
criminal history can adversely affect employment prospects which can further influence an
individual’s level of income, housing opportunities, and access to quality health care.
Employment is key to stable housing and homeownership and a variety of State and national data
show that higher incomes can lead to the stability and consistency necessary to accumulate the
various upfront resources needed to buy a home. Monetary savings for down payments and good
credit scores are necessary to achieve initial homeownership and are largely driven by an
individual’s employment status and level of income. Employment also often dictates one’s access
to health care. Certain jobs do not offer health insurance benefits and access to jobs with such
benefits may be restricted by an attachment to a criminal record. A criminal record can therefore
impose significant barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility.
Impacts of the Bill
National and State data consistently show that racial minorities experience disproportionate levels
of adversity in the areas of life affected by a criminal record. National studies have found that there
is a significant negative effect of having a criminal record on employment outcomes that appears
substantially larger for Black individuals. The Department of Public Safety and Correctional
Services reports that for fiscal 2023, Black individuals made up 71% of Maryland’s prison
population contrasted with their 29% share of the State’s overall population. As shown in
Exhibit 1, in 2023, the unemployment rate in Maryland was highest among Black job seekers and
almost twice the rate of white job seekers in the State.

Despite the lack of available data regarding those convicted of second-degree escape, the bill’s
provisions would be expected to yield positive outcomes for those who are able to expunge their
criminal records.
Conclusion
Allowing for the filing of expungement petitions as specified under the bill could alleviate some
of the negative consequences of having a criminal record for those convicted of escape in the
second degree. Demographic data of those convicted of failure to obey a court order to report to
confinement was not available, but the relatively small number of individuals charged and
convicted of this violation suggests that the bill’s impact would be positive for those individuals
but minimal overall. According to the Judiciary, there were 43 convictions in the State’s trial courts
for second-degree escape in fiscal 2022 and 2023 combined. Black expungement applicants may
see the most impact to the extent they are convicted of this violation at higher rates, which their
overall overrepresentation in the State’s criminal justice system suggests may be the case.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
