2 HOUSE BILL 870
1 Article – Business Regulation
2 Subtitle 4. Tobacco Product Manufacturers [Escrow] EQUITY Act.
3 16–401.
4 (a) Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State and to
5 the citizens of the State. The United States Surgeon General has determined that smoking
6 causes lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds
7 of thousands of tobacco–related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most
8 often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.
9 (b) Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the State.
10 Under certain health care programs, the State may have a legal obligation to provide
11 medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette
12 smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive the medical assistance.
13 (c) Under these programs, the State pays millions of dollars each year to provide
14 medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette
15 smoking.
16 (d) It is the policy of the State that financial burdens imposed on the State by
17 cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the State [to
18 the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the
19 State or are found culpable by the courts] AND, FOR THAT PURPOSE, TOBACCO
20 PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS THAT HAVE SETTLED WITH THE STATE PAY THE STATE
21 MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR, UNLIKE OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCT
22 MANUFACTURERS THAT DO NOT MAKE DIRECT PAYMENTS.
23 (e) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers
24 entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the “Master Settlement Agreement”, with
25 the State. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for
26 a release of past, present, and certain future claims against them as described in the
27 Agreement, to pay substantial sums to the State (tied in part to their volume of sales); to
28 fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make
29 substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture,
30 with the intention of reducing underage smoking.
31 (f) [(1) It would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product
32 manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost
33 advantage to derive large, short–term profits in the years before liability may arise without
34 ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are
35 proven to have acted culpably.
36 (2) It is thus in the interest of the State to require such tobacco product
37 manufacturers to establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation in order

HOUSE BILL 870 3
1 to prevent them from deriving large, short–term profits and then becoming judgment–proof
2 before liability may arise] THE PUBLIC HEALTH OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE ARE
3 OWED EQUALLY TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE WHO SMOKE, REGARDLESS OF
4 THE BRAND OF CIGARETTE SMOKED OR THE STATUS OF THE TOBACCO PRODUCT
5 MANUFACTURER UNDER THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.
6 (G) IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE POLICY OF THE STATE TO REQUIRE
7 TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS THAT DO NOT MAKE PAYMENTS DIRECTLY TO
8 THE STATE THROUGH THE MASTER SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT TO PAY AN AMOUNT
9 THAT IS INTENDED TO:
10 (1) PREVENT MANUFACTURERS FROM DERIVING LARGE,
11 SHORT–TERM PROFITS AND THEN BECOMING JUDGMENT–PROOF;
12 (2) REQUIRE TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS TO INTERNALIZE
13 THE HEALTH CARE COSTS IMPOSED ON THE STATE BY CIGARETTE SMOKING;
14 (3) INCREASE THE PRICE OF CIGARETTES TO REDUCE SMOKING
15 RATES, PARTICULARLY AMONG THE YOUTH OF THE STATE; AND
16 (4) SERVE AS PARTIAL COMPENSATION FOR THE FINANCIAL
17 BURDENS IMPOSED ON THE STATE BY CIGARETTE SMOKING.
18 16–403.
19 (a) Any tobacco product manufacturer that sells cigarettes to consumers within
20 the State, whether directly or through a distributor, retailer, or similar intermediary or
21 intermediaries, after June 1, 1999, shall either:
22 (1) become a participating manufacturer, as that term is defined in section
23 II(jj) of the Master Settlement Agreement, and generally perform its financial obligations
24 under the Master Settlement Agreement; or
25 (2) (I) [place] HAVE PLACED into a qualified escrow fund by April 15
26 of the year following the year in question the following amounts, as such amounts are
27 adjusted for inflation:
28 [(i)] 1. for 1999, $.0094241 per unit sold after June 1, 1999;
29 [(ii)] 2. for 2000, $.0104712 per unit sold;
30 [(iii)] 3. for each of 2001 and 2002, $.0136125 per unit sold;
31 [(iv)] 4. for each of 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006, $.0167539 per unit
32 sold; and

4 HOUSE BILL 870
1 [(v)] 5. for 2007 [and each year thereafter] THROUGH 2025,
2 $.0188482 per unit sold; AND
3 (II) BEGINNING IN 2026 AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER, PAY TO
4 THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AN EQUITY FEE OF $.0188482 PER UNIT SOLD, AS
5 ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION.

7 escrow in accordance with subsection [(a)(2)] (A)(2)(I) of this section shall receive the
8 interest or other appreciation on the funds as earned.
9 (2) The funds themselves shall be released from escrow only under the
10 following circumstances:
11 (i) to pay a judgment or settlement on any released claim brought
12 against such tobacco product manufacturer by the State or any releasing party located or
13 residing in the State. Funds shall be released from escrow under this subparagraph:
14 1. in the order in which they were placed into escrow; and
15 2. only to the extent and at the time necessary to make
16 payments required under such judgment or settlement;
17 (ii) to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes
18 that the amount it was required to place into escrow on account of units sold in the State
19 in a particular year was greater than the Master Settlement Agreement payments, as
20 determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that Agreement, including after final determination
21 of all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make on account
22 of such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released
23 from escrow and revert back to such tobacco manufacturer; or
24 (iii) to the extent funds are not released from escrow under item (i)
25 or (ii) of this paragraph, funds shall be released from escrow and revert to such tobacco
26 product manufacturer 25 years after the date on which they were placed into escrow.
27 (C) A TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER THAT TIMELY PAYS THE EQUITY
28 FEE UNDER SUBSECTION (A)(2)(II) OF THIS SECTION MAY CONTEST THE AMOUNT OF
29 THE EQUITY FEE REQUIRED WITHIN 1 YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF PAYMENT.
30 (D) (1) THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SHALL DISTRIBUTE THE EQUITY FEES

2 the provisions of this Act are not severable, and if all or any portion of the equity fee
3 established under § 16–403 of the Business Regulation Article, as enacted under Section 1
4 of this Act, results in a determination by the Firm, as that term is defined by the Master

6 Article no longer constitutes a qualifying statute, as that term is defined in § IX(d)(1)(C) of
