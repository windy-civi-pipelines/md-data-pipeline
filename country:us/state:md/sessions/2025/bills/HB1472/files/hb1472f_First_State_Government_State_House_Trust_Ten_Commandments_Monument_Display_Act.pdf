2 HOUSE BILL 1472
1 displaying of the Ten Commandments on public property may have “multiple purposes”
2 such as “historical significance” and represents a “common cultural heritage”; and
3 WHEREAS, Recognizing the historical role of the Ten Commandments accords with
4 our nation’s history and faithfully reflects the understanding of the founders of our nation
5 with respect to the necessity of civic morality to a functional self–government; history
6 records that James Madison, the fourth President of the United States, stated that “[w]e
7 have staked the whole future of our new nation…upon the capacity of each of ourselves to
8 govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments”; and
9 WHEREAS, In order that they may understand and appreciate the basic principles
10 of the American system of government, the people of the United States and the State of
11 Maryland need to identify the Ten Commandments, one of many sources, as influencing
12 the development of what has become modern law; and
13 WHEREAS, The placing of a monument to the Ten Commandments on the grounds
14 of the Maryland State House would help the people of the United States and the State of
15 Maryland to know the Ten Commandments as the moral foundation of the law; and
16 WHEREAS, It is the Legislature’s intent to apply the decision set forth by the U.S.
17 Supreme Court in Van Orden v. Perry, to continue the rich tradition and ensure that the
18 citizens of our State may understand and appreciate the foundational documents of our
19 State and national government, and that in the placing of a monument to the Ten
20 Commandments on the grounds of the Maryland State House would help the people of the
21 United States and the State of Maryland to recognize the Ten Commandments as the moral
22 foundation of the law; now, therefore,
23 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
24 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
