Section 1:
2025 Session
SB0649
Terminated Without Finding
Bill Summary
This bill expands eligibility for an expungement under § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article
to include a charge that was not disposed of by unequivocal conviction but was instead (1) disposed
of by the court with a no finding designation or (2) included in a case that was designated by the
court as having been terminated without finding.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s expansion of expungement eligibility could help mitigate the adverse impacts resulting
from a conviction such as difficulty obtaining employment, housing, education, licensing, and
other government services as a result of a criminal record. The Judiciary advises that it is unclear
what case dispositions the bill applies to, so there is no data available to measure specific impacts.
However, national and State data confirm that Black individuals are overrepresented in the
criminal justice system and often experience higher rates of unemployment. Individuals with
criminal convictions not covered under current expungement rules would benefit to the extent that
they take advantage of expungement opportunities offered by the expanded eligibility provisions
of the bill.
Analysis
The bill expands opportunities for expungement by authorizing a person to file a petition for
expungement of any misdemeanor or felony charge that was not disposed of by unequivocal
conviction, but instead was disposed of without any final disposition. Existing case dispositions
include acquittal, stet, dismissal, probation, and nolle prosequi.
SB 649/ Page 1
Expungements – Section 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article
In general, a person seeking expungement of records pertaining to a criminal charge must file a
petition for expungement with the court under § 10-105 or § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure
Article. With some exceptions, § 10-105 applies to dispositions other than a conviction, and

Section 2:
§ 10-110 applies to expungements of convictions.
Under § 10-105 of the Criminal Procedure Article, a person who has been charged with the
commission of a crime for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed or who has been charged
with a civil offense or infraction, except a juvenile offense, may file a petition for expungement of
a police record, court record, or other record maintained by the State or a political subdivision of
the State under various circumstances listed in the statute. With specified exceptions, these grounds
include acquittal, dismissal of charges, entry of probation before judgment, entry of nolle prosequi,
stet of charge, and gubernatorial pardon. Individuals convicted of a crime that is no longer a crime,
convicted of possession of cannabis under § 5-601 of the Criminal Law Article, convicted of or
found not criminally responsible for specified public nuisance crimes or specified misdemeanors,
or who had a conviction vacated due to being a victim of human trafficking (as defined in statute),
are also eligible for expungement of the associated criminal records under certain circumstances.

Section 3:
Section 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article authorizes an individual convicted of any of a
list of approximately 100 specified offenses, or an attempt, a conspiracy, or a solicitation of any
of these offenses, to file a petition for expungement of the conviction, subject to specified
procedures and requirements.
Automatic Expungements – Section 10-105.1 of the Criminal Procedure Article
Pursuant to Chapter 680 of 2021, beginning October 1, 2021, any police record, court record, or
other record maintained by the State or a political subdivision of the State relating to the charging
of a civil offense under § 5-601(c)(2)(ii) (related to possession of cannabis) of the Criminal Law
Article or a crime other than a violation of the Transportation Article for which the defendant is
not required to appear, must be expunged three years after a disposition of the charge if no charge
in the case resulted in a disposition other than acquittal; dismissal; not guilty; or nolle prosequi,
other than nolle prosequi with a requirement of drug or alcohol treatment.
Collateral Consequences of a Criminal Record
Expungement, in general, is intended to help mitigate the adverse consequences of having a
criminal record, which can last beyond imprisonment, fines, and the legal process and can include
the denial of civil opportunities and benefits available to a person due to their record. Specifically,
having a criminal history can adversely affect employment prospects which can further influence
an individual’s level of income, housing opportunities, and access to quality health care.
Employment is key to stable housing and homeownership and a variety of State and national data
shows that higher incomes can lead to the stability and consistency necessary to accumulate the
various upfront resources needed to buy a home. Monetary savings for down payments and good
credit scores are necessary to achieve initial homeownership and are largely driven by an
individual’s employment status and level of income. Employment also often dictates one’s access
to health care. Certain jobs do not offer health insurance benefits and access to jobs with such
SB 649/ Page 2
benefits may be restricted by an attachment to a criminal record. A criminal record can therefore
impose significant barriers to upward socioeconomic mobility.
Impacts of the Bill
According to the Administrative Office of the Courts, there were 46,251 petitions for expungement
in Maryland’s circuit courts and the District Court in fiscal 2023 and 54,069 petitions in
fiscal 2024, which are sizable increases from the 38,448 expungement petitions in fiscal 2022
following the legislative expansion of eligibility for expungement. There is currently no
demographic data available that indicates the racial and ethnic composition of individuals
impacted by expungement.
National and State data consistently show that racial minorities experience disproportionate levels
of adversity in the areas of life affected by a criminal record. National studies have found that there
is a significant negative effect of having a criminal record on employment outcomes that appears
substantially larger for Black individuals. Exhibit 1 shows that in 2023, the unemployment rate in
Maryland was highest among Black job seekers and nearly twice the rate of white job seekers in
the State.

The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services reports that, as of January 1, 2025,
Black individuals made up 71% of Maryland’s prison population contrasted with their 29% share
of the State’s overall population.
SB 649/ Page 3
The bill’s expungement provisions for the specif ied cases will likely impact Black individuals to
a greater extent as these individuals are overrepresented in charges, arrests, and incarceration for
many crimes at a disproportionately high rate, making them also disproportionately affected by
the collateral consequences of criminal records. However, the Judiciary advises that because it is
not familiar with the terminology referenced in the bill and its case management system does not
use this terminology, it cannot estimate the impacts of the bill on expungement filing activity and
court workloads. Assuming the bill applies to a small and unique group of dispositions, the overall
impacts of its provisions are likely limited.
Conclusion
The bill’s provisions expanding opportunities for expungement will enable successful applicants
to refrain from disclosing certain convictions and contacts that may prevent them from achieving
employment and all the ancillary benefits and opportunities that come with it, such as improved
housing and health care opportunities. The bill will likely impact Black individuals to a greater
extent as these individuals are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates in Maryland. The exact
equity impacts of the bill cannot be estimated without clarity on what case dispositions the bill
applies to, as the Judiciary advises that the case dispositions referred to in the bill are not used in
its case management system. Additionally, historical demographic data on expungement
applicants, individuals eligible for expungement under the bill, and prospective employment data
for individuals with expunged records would be needed to assess specific impacts.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
