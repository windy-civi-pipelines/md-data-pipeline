2025 Session
HB0621
Criminal Procedure - Expungement - Adverse Actions and Removal
From Maryland Electronic Courts (MDEC) System
Bill Summary
This bill provides that the refusal of a person to disclose information about criminal charges that
have been expunged may not be the sole reason for a unit, official, or employee of the State to
deny the person’s application for a license, permit, registration, or governmental service or for an
educational institution to expel or refuse to admit a person. In addition, the bill establishes that the
Maryland Electronic Courts (MDEC) system may not refer to the existence of a criminal case in
which the possession of cannabis is the only charge and the charge was disposed of before
July 1, 2023.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s provisions protect individuals from discrimination by specified governmental entities
and educational institutions when they do not disclose expunged records of criminal charges or
convictions. The bill also ensures that expunged records for specified cannabis possession charges
are removed from the MDEC system. There is no data currently available to estimate the extent of
the bill’s impacts since no dispositive data exists regarding (1) the demographic composition of
applicants for expungement; (2) denials of licenses, permits, registrations, or admissions by
governmental entities or educational institutions; and (3) denials specifically based on refusals to
disclose expunged records. Statewide criminal justice data suggests, however, that Black
individuals, in particular, could benefit under the bill to the extent they are currently denied
services for failing to disclose expunged records.

Analysis
The bill generally modifies State law to remove barriers faced by individuals with expunged
criminal records by prohibiting denials of access to occupational licenses, permits, registrations,
or governmental services based solely on an individual’s refusal to disclose information regarding
an expunged criminal record. Refusal to disclose this information may also not be used as a sole
justification for expulsion from, or admittance to, an educational institution. The bill prohibits the
MDEC system from referring to a case where the only charge was possession of cannabis and the
case was disposed of before July 1, 2023.
Expungements Generally
Records eligible for expungement in Maryland include records of (1) arrest and detention;
(2) criminal charges; (3) suspected violations of a criminal law; (4) violations of the Transportation
Article for which a term of imprisonment may be imposed; and (5) a civil offense or infraction,
with some exceptions for specified juvenile offenses. Existing law requires the Department of
Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) to expunge or remove all references in the
central repository to cases where the only charge is cannabis possession if the charge was issued
prior to July 1, 2023.
Specifically, § 10-110 of the Criminal Procedure Article authorizes an individual convicted of any
of a list of approximately 100 specified offenses, or an attempt, a conspiracy, or a solicitation of
any of these offenses, to file a petition for expungement of the conviction, subject to specified
procedures and requirements. With some exceptions, to begin the process of expungement, a
petitioner must file a petition for expungement with the court under § 10-105 or § 10-110 of the
Criminal Procedure Article, which establishes eligibility for the expungement of records pertaining
to a criminal charge or conviction. In general, § 10-110 applies to expungements of convictions,
and § 10-105 applies to the expungement of criminal charges that resulted in a disposition other
than a conviction.
Potential Impacts
The bill’s provisions could help protect individuals with expunged records of criminal charges
and/or convictions from the denial of economic opportunities based solely on their refusal to
disclose expunged information. Criminal records, regardless of their nature, pose a significant
challenge for individuals seeking to rebuild their lives following a conviction, arrest, or charge.
Securing employment, housing, health care, education, and access to government services can all
be more difficult for those with a criminal history. Previous research has detailed notable collateral
consequences to having a criminal record that often exacerbate the challenges of social
reintegration following imprisonment. Even individuals convicted of criminal charges that do not
face imprisonment may still see significant adverse effects resulting from a criminal record.
According to the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), there were 46,251 petitions for
expungement in fiscal 2023 and 54,069 petitions for expungement in fiscal 2024 in both the district
and circuit courts. There is no demographic data currently available that indicates the racial and
ethnic composition of expungement applicants.
HB 621/ Page 2

Assuming that trends for expungement applications are similar to trends for charges, convictions,
and incarceration in the State, a significant number and percentage of Black individuals could
benefit from protections under the bill. DPSCS reports that, as of January 2025, Black individuals
made up 72% of Maryland’s prison population contrasted with their 29% share of the State’s
overall population. It is therefore a reasonable assumption that Black individuals comprise a
meaningful portion of the population seeking to expunge criminal records.
By way of example, records of cannabis possession violations are eligible for expungement under
specified conditions. According to AOC data, Black individuals comprised 67% of those charged
for various possession violations between 2010 and 2021 compared to 30% of their white
counterparts. Assuming that the overall pool of expungement applicants is similarly distributed,
Black individuals are likely the most affected by the provisions of the bill.
Applicant and Denial Data
No reliable data exists to indicate significant denial activity by governmental and/or educational
entities related to individuals that have criminal records. Chapter 796 of 2018 required specified
departments to report information related to the denial of licenses or certificates for the preceding
five years based on an applicant’s criminal history. While some of the departments covered under
Chapter 796 reported little to no data, the Maryland Department of Labor and the Maryland
Department of Health reported that less than 1% of the applicants for various licenses were
individuals with criminal histories.
There is even less data regarding denials due to an applicant’s refusal to disclose information
within an expunged criminal record. There is also no data on admittance denials and/or expulsions
from educational institutions. Despite the absence of meaningful data documenting actual adverse
impacts under existing law, the bill’s provisions could potentially encourage more individuals with
a criminal record to apply for governmental or educational services.
Conclusion
There is no way to reliably measure the impacts of the bill without demographic data for
expungement applicants, applicants to the entities covered by the bill, and recent data relating to
the reasons for denial of applications by governmental entities and/or educational institutions. To
the extent that individuals are denied or discouraged to apply for licenses, permits, registrations,
and governmental services, or denied admittance to educational institutions solely due to their
refusal to disclose information contained within an expunged criminal record, the provisions of
the bill would provide more access to education, employment, professional development, and the
economic security afforded by such access. Black individuals could benefit the most from the bill
as these individuals are overrepresented in the population of those charged, arrested, convicted,
and incarcerated for many of the crimes eligible for expungement.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
