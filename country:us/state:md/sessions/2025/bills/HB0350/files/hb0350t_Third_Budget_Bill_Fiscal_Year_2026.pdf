30 exceptions for special education
31 students as determined by the
32 department including students

3 The department shall establish a process to
4 ensure that the local education agencies
5 are effectively and promptly working with
6 the nonpublic schools to assure that the
7 nonpublic schools have appropriate access
8 to federal funds for which they are eligible.
9 Further provided that the Maryland State
10 Department of Education shall:
11 (1) Assure that the process for
12 textbook, computer hardware, and
13 computer software acquisition uses
14 a list of qualified textbook,

18 computer software; uses textbooks,
19 computer hardware, and computer
20 software that are secular in
21 character and acceptable for use in
22 any public elementary or secondary

13 Further provided that a nonpublic school
14 participating in the Aid to Non–Public
15 Schools Program R00A03.04 shall certify
16 compliance with Title 20, Subtitle 6 of the
17 State Government Article. A nonpublic

20 retention, or expulsion, or otherwise
21 discriminate against any student on the
22 basis of race, color, national origin, sexual
23 orientation, or gender identity or

26 (2) MSDE shall establish procedures
27 for the application and award
28 process for scholarships for
29 students who are eligible for the
30 free or reduced–price lunch

14 as the chair. A member of the
15 BOOST Advisory Board may not be
16 an elected official and may not have
17 any financial interest in an eligible
18 nonpublic school.
19 (6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
20 review and certify the ranked list of
21 applicants and shall determine the
22 scholarship award amounts. The
23 BOOST Advisory Board shall take

28 scholarship award amounts.
29 (7) MSDE shall make scholarship
30 awards to eligible students as

23 priority shall be given to students
24 who attended public schools in the
25 prior school year.
26 Further provided that the BOOST Advisory
27 Board shall make all scholarship awards no

7 systems necessary to determine the extent to which funds appropriated for fiscal 2025 in
8 program N00G00.01 Foster Care Maintenance Payments have been disbursed for services
9 provided in that fiscal year, including detail by placement type for the average monthly
10 caseload, average monthly cost per case, and the total expended for each foster care
11 program, and to prepare the monthly reports required under this section for that program.
12 (4) For the programs specified, reports must indicate by fund type total
13 appropriations for fiscal 2025 and total disbursements for services provided during that
14 fiscal year up through the last day of the second month preceding the date on which the
15 report is to be submitted and a comparison to data applicable to those periods in the
16 preceding fiscal year.
17 (5) Reports shall be submitted to the budget committees, the Department
18 of Legislative Services, the Department of Budget and Management, and the Comptroller
19 beginning August 15, 2025, and submitted on a monthly basis thereafter.
20 (6) It is the intent of the General Assembly that general funds appropriated
21 for fiscal 2025 to the programs specified that have not been disbursed within a reasonable
22 period, not to exceed 12 months from the end of the fiscal year, shall revert.
23 SECTION 30. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That no position identification
24 number assigned to a position abolished in this budget may be reassigned to a job or
25 function different from that to which it was assigned when the budget was submitted to the
26 General Assembly. Incumbents in positions abolished may continue State employment in
27 another position.
28 SECTION 31. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Accounting
29 Division of the Comptroller of Maryland shall establish a subsidiary ledger control account
30 to debit all State agency funds budgeted under subobject 0175 (Workers’ Compensation)
31 and to credit all payments disbursed to the Injured Workers’ Insurance Fund (IWIF) via
32 transmittal. The control account shall also record all funds withdrawn from IWIF and

35 account.
36 SECTION 32. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Board of Public Works
37 (BPW), in exercising its authority to create additional positions pursuant to Section 7–236
38 of the State Finance and Procurement Article, may authorize during the fiscal year no more
39 than 100 positions in excess of the total number of authorized State positions on July 1,
40 2025, as determined by the Secretary of Budget and Management. Provided, however, that

306 HOUSE BILL 350
1 if the imposition of this ceiling causes undue hardship in any department, agency, board,
2 or commission, additional positions may be created for that affected unit to the extent that
3 an equal number of positions authorized by the General Assembly for the fiscal year are
4 abolished in that unit or in other units of State government. It is further provided that the
5 limit of 100 does not apply to any position that may be created in conformance with specific
6 manpower statutes that may be enacted by the State or federal government nor to any
7 positions created to implement block grant actions or to implement a program reflecting
8 fundamental changes in federal/State relationships. Notwithstanding anything contained
9 in this section, BPW may authorize additional positions to meet public emergencies
10 resulting from an act of God and violent acts of man that are necessary to protect the health
11 and safety of the people of Maryland. BPW may authorize the creation of additional
12 positions within the Executive Branch provided that 1.25 contractual full–time equivalents
13 (FTE) are abolished for each regular position authorized and that there be no increase in
14 agency funds in the current budget and the next two subsequent budgets as the result of
15 this action. It is the intent of the General Assembly that priority is given to converting
16 individuals that have been in contractual FTEs for at least two years. Any position created
17 by this method may not be counted within the limitation of 100 under this section. The
18 numerical limitation on the creation of positions by BPW established in this section may
19 not apply to positions entirely supported by funds from federal or other non–State sources
20 so long as both the appointing authority for the position and the Secretary of Budget and
21 Management certify for each position created under this exception that:
22 (1) funds are available from non–State sources for each position
23 established under this exception; and
24 (2) any positions created will be abolished in the event that non–State
25 funds are no longer available. The Secretary of Budget and Management shall certify and
26 report to the General Assembly by June 30, 2026, the status of positions created with
27 non–State funding sources during fiscal 2023 through 2026 under this provision as
28 remaining, authorized, or abolished due to the discontinuation of funds.
29 SECTION 33. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That immediately following the
30 close of fiscal 2025, the Secretary of Budget and Management shall determine the total
31 number of full–time equivalent (FTE) positions that are authorized as of the last day of
32 fiscal 2025 and on the first day of fiscal 2026. Authorized positions shall include all
33 positions authorized by the General Assembly in the personnel detail of the budgets for
34 fiscal 2025 and 2026, including nonbudgetary programs, the Maryland Transportation
35 Authority, the University System of Maryland self–supported activities, and Maryland
36 Correctional Enterprises. The Department of Budget and Management shall also prepare
37 a report during fiscal 2026 for the budget committees upon creation of regular FTE
38 positions through Board of Public Works action and upon transfer or abolition of positions.
39 It shall note, at the program level:
40 (1) where regular FTE positions have been abolished;
41 (2) where regular FTE positions have been created;

HOUSE BILL 350 307
1 (3) from where and to where regular FTE positions have been transferred;
2 and
3 (4) where any other adjustments have been made. Provision of contractual
4 FTE information in the same fashion as reported in the appendices of the Governor’s Fiscal
5 2026 Budget Books shall also be provided.
6 Further provided that this report shall also be submitted as an appendix with the
7 Governor’s Fiscal 2027 Budget Books, and that the report shall provide information that is
8 consistent with information in the individual agency pages of the Budget Books and with
9 data provided to the Department of Legislative Services.
10 SECTION 34. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Secretary of Budget and
11 Management shall include as an appendix in the Governor’s Fiscal 2027 Budget Books an
12 accounting of the fiscal 2025 actual, fiscal 2026 working appropriation, and fiscal 2027
13 estimated revenues and expenditures associated with the employees’ and retirees’ health
14 plan. The data in this report should be consistent with the budget data submitted to the
15 Department of Legislative Services. This accounting shall include:
16 (1) any health plan receipts received from State agencies, as well as
17 prescription rebates or recoveries, or audit recoveries, and other miscellaneous recoveries;
18 (2) any health plan receipts received from employees and retirees, broken
19 out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees;
20 (3) any premium, capitated, or claims expenditures paid on behalf of State
21 employees and retirees for any health, mental health, dental, or prescription plan, as well
22 as any administrative costs not covered by these plans, with health, mental health, and
23 prescription drug expenditures broken out by medical payments for active employees,
24 non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees, and prescription drug
25 expenditures broken out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and
26 Medicare–eligible retirees; and
27 (4) any balance remaining and held in reserve for future provider
28 payments.
29 SECTION 35. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That $100,000 of the general fund
30 appropriation of the Department of Human Services Social Services Administration,

2 (2) the total number and one–day counts (as of October 15) of out–of–state
3 placements, including the number of family home, community–based, and
4 noncommunity–based out–of–state placements for fiscal 2023, 2024, and 2025 categorized
5 by state and by age category;
6 (3) the costs associated with out–of–home placements;
7 (4) an explanation of recent placement trends;
8 (5) findings of child abuse and neglect occurring while families are

21 SECTION 36. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That $100,000 of the general fund
22 appropriation within the Department of State Police (DSP) may not be expended until DSP
23 submits the Crime in Maryland, 2024 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) to the budget
24 committees. The budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the
25 report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of the report may not
26 be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to
27 the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees.
28 Further provided that, if DSP encounters difficulty obtaining, or validating the
29 accuracy of, the necessary crime data by November 1, 2025, from local jurisdictions who
30 provide the data for inclusion in the UCR, DSP shall notify the Governor’s Office of Crime
31 Prevention and Policy (GOCPP). From each jurisdiction’s third quarterly State Aid for
32 Police Protection (SAPP) disbursement, the office shall withhold a portion, totaling at least
33 15% but no more than 50%, of that jurisdiction’s SAPP grant for fiscal 2026 upon receipt of
