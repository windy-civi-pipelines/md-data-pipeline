21 retention, or expulsion or
22 otherwise discriminate
23 against any student on the
24 basis of race, color, national
25 origin, sexual orientation, or
26 gender identity or
27 expression. Nothing herein
28 shall require any school or
29 institution to adopt any rule,
30 regulation, or policy that
31 conflicts with its religious or
32 moral teachings. However,
33 all participating schools
34 must agree that they will not
35 discriminate in student
36 admissions, retention, or

44 comply with these
45 requirements, it shall

BUDGET BILL 115
1 reimburse MSDE all
2 scholarship funds received
3 under the BOOST Program
4 for the 2025–2026 school
5 year and may not charge the
6 student tuition and fees
7 instead. The only other legal
8 remedy for violation of this
9 provision is ineligibility for
10 participating in the BOOST
11 Program.
12 (2) MSDE shall establish procedures
13 for the application and award
14 process for scholarships for
15 students who are eligible for the
16 free or reduced–price lunch
17 program. The procedures shall
18 include consideration for award
19 adjustments if an eligible student
20 becomes ineligible during the
21 course of the school year. The
22 BOOST Advisory Board shall
23 prioritize awards for current
24 BOOST recipients and their
25 siblings and a student shall receive
26 no less than the fiscal 2024 base
27 award amount.

32 recent federal poverty levels.
33 (4) MSDE shall submit the ranked list
34 of applicants to the BOOST
35 Advisory Board.
36 (5) There is a BOOST Advisory Board
37 that shall be appointed as follows: 2
38 members appointed by the
39 Governor, 2 members appointed by
40 the President of the Senate, 2
41 members appointed by the Speaker
42 of the House of Delegates, and 1
43 member jointly appointed by the

1 President and the Speaker to serve
2 as the chair. A member of the
3 BOOST Advisory Board may not be
4 an elected official and may not have
5 any financial interest in an eligible
6 nonpublic school.
7 (6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
8 review and certify the ranked list of
9 applicants and shall determine the
10 scholarship award amounts. The
11 BOOST Advisory Board shall take
12 into account the needs of students
13 with disabilities on an
14 Individualized Education Plan or
15 504 Plan when determining
16 scholarship award amounts.
17 (7) MSDE shall make scholarship
18 awards to eligible students as
19 determined by the BOOST Advisory
20 Board.
21 (8) Unless the student has special
22 needs due to a disability, the
23 amount of a scholarship award may
24 not exceed the lesser of:
25 (a) the statewide average per
26 pupil expenditure by local
27 education agencies, as
28 calculated by MSDE; or
29 (b) the tuition of the nonpublic
30 school.

32 Program reporting requirements to
33 the budget committees, MSDE shall
34 specify a date by which
35 participating nonpublic schools
36 must submit information to MSDE
37 so that it may complete its required
38 report. Any nonpublic schools that
39 do not provide the necessary
40 information by that specified date
41 shall be ineligible to participate in

BUDGET BILL 117
1 the BOOST Program.
2 (10) Students who received a BOOST
3 Program scholarship award in the

15 later than December 31, 2025, for the
