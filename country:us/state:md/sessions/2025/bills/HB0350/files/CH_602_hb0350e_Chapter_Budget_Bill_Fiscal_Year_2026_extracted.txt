Further provided that the Maryland State
– 189 –
Ch. 602 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
Department of Education shall:
(1) Assure that the process for
textbook, computer hardware, and

discriminate against any student on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sexual
orientation, or gender identity or
expression. Nothing herein shall require
any school or institution to adopt any rule,
regulation, or policy that conflicts with its
religious or moral teachings. However, all
participating schools must agree that they
will not discriminate in student
admissions, retention, or expulsion or
otherwise discriminate against any
student on the basis of race, color, national

identity or expression. Any school found to
be in violation of the requirements to not
discriminate shall be required to return to
the Maryland State Department of
Education all textbooks or computer
hardware and software and other
electronically delivered learning materials
acquired through the fiscal 2025 allocation.
The only other legal remedy for violation of

(d) comply with Title VI of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 as
amended, Title 20, Subtitle 6
of the State Government
Article, and not discriminate
in student admissions,
retention, or expulsion or
otherwise discriminate
against any student on the
basis of race, color, national
origin, sexual orientation, or
gender identity or
expression. Nothing herein
shall require any school or
institution to adopt any rule,
regulation, or policy that
conflicts with its religious or
moral teachings. However,
all participating schools
must agree that they will not
discriminate in student
admissions, retention, or
expulsion or otherwise
discriminate against any
– 193 –
Ch. 602 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
student based on race, color,
national origin, sexual
orientation, or gender
identity or expression. If a
nonpublic school does not
comply with these
requirements, it shall
reimburse MSDE all
scholarship funds received
under the BOOST Program
for the 2025–2026 school
year and may not charge the
student tuition and fees
instead. The only other legal
remedy for violation of this
provision is ineligibility for
participating in the BOOST
Program.
(2) MSDE shall establish procedures
for the application and award
process for scholarships for
students who are eligible for the
free or reduced–price lunch
program. The procedures shall
include consideration for award
adjustments if an eligible student
becomes ineligible during the
course of the school year. The
BOOST Advisory Board shall
prioritize awards for current
BOOST recipients and their
siblings and a student shall receive
no less than the fiscal 2024 base
award amount.
(3) MSDE shall compile and certify a
list of applicants that ranks eligible
students by family income
expressed as a percent of the most
recent federal poverty levels.
(4) MSDE shall submit the ranked list
of applicants to the BOOST
Advisory Board.
– 194 –
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 602
(5) There is a BOOST Advisory Board
that shall be appointed as follows: 2
members appointed by the
Governor, 2 members appointed by
the President of the Senate, 2
members appointed by the Speaker
of the House of Delegates, and 1
member jointly appointed by the
President and the Speaker to serve
as the chair. A member of the
BOOST Advisory Board may not be
an elected official and may not have
any financial interest in an eligible
nonpublic school.
(6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
review and certify the ranked list of
applicants and shall determine the
scholarship award amounts. The
BOOST Advisory Board shall take
into account the needs of students
with disabilities on an
Individualized Education Plan or
504 Plan when determining
scholarship award amounts.
(7) MSDE shall make scholarship
awards to eligible students as
determined by the BOOST Advisory
Board.
(8) Unless the student has special
needs due to a disability, the
amount of a scholarship award may
not exceed the lesser of:
(a) the statewide average per
pupil expenditure by local
education agencies, as
calculated by MSDE; or
(b) the tuition of the nonpublic
school.
(9) In order to meet its BOOST
Program reporting requirements to
– 195 –
Ch. 602 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
the budget committees, MSDE shall
specify a date by which
participating nonpublic schools
must submit information to MSDE
so that it may complete its required
report. Any nonpublic schools that
do not provide the necessary
information by that specified date
shall be ineligible to participate in
the BOOST Program.
(10) Students who received a BOOST
Program scholarship award in the
prior year who still meet eligibility
criteria for a scholarship shall
receive a scholarship renewal
award. For students who are
receiving a BOOST Program
scholarship for the first time,
priority shall be given to students
who attended public schools in the
prior school year.
Further provided that the BOOST Advisory
Board shall make all scholarship awards no
later than December 31, 2025, for the
2025–2026 school year to eligible
individuals. Any unexpended funds not
awarded to students for scholarships shall
be encumbered at the end of fiscal 2026 and
available for scholarships in the 2026–2027
school year.
Further provided that $617,522 of this
appropriation shall be used only to provide
an additional award for each student with
special needs that is at least equal in
amount to the Broadening Options and
Opportunities for Students Today
(BOOST) Program scholarship award that
a student is awarded in accordance with
paragraph (6) above.
Further provided that the Maryland State
Department of Education (MSDE) shall
submit a report to the budget committees
– 196 –
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 602

may authorize a change in the amount of funds so allotted.
The Secretary shall, before the beginning of the fiscal year, file with the Comptroller
of the Treasury a schedule of allotments, if any a list limited to the appropriations restricted
in this Act to be placed in contingency reserve. The Comptroller shall not authorize any
expenditure or obligation in excess of the allotment made and any expenditure so made

or wages nor any request for or certification of personnel shall be made except in accordance
with the Secretary’s determinations. At any time during the fiscal year the Secretary may
amend the number and classes of positions or person years of employment previously fixed
by the Secretary; the Secretary may delegate all or part of this authority. The governing

SECTION 30. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That no position identification
number assigned to a position abolished in this budget may be reassigned to a job or
function different from that to which it was assigned when the budget was submitted to the
General Assembly. Incumbents in positions abolished may continue State employment in
another position.

Section 47:
SECTION 31. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Accounting
Division of the Comptroller of Maryland shall establish a subsidiary ledger control account
to debit all State agency funds budgeted under subobject 0175 (Workers’ Compensation)
and to credit all payments disbursed to the Injured Workers’ Insurance Fund (IWIF) via
transmittal. The control account shall also record all funds withdrawn from IWIF and
returned to the State and subsequently transferred to the General Fund. IWIF shall submit

Section 48:
SECTION 32. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Board of Public Works
(BPW), in exercising its authority to create additional positions pursuant to Section 7–236
of the State Finance and Procurement Article, may authorize during the fiscal year no more
than 100 positions in excess of the total number of authorized State positions on July 1,
2025, as determined by the Secretary of Budget and Management. Provided, however, that
if the imposition of this ceiling causes undue hardship in any department, agency, board,
or commission, additional positions may be created for that affected unit to the extent that
an equal number of positions authorized by the General Assembly for the fiscal year are
abolished in that unit or in other units of State government. It is further provided that the
limit of 100 does not apply to any position that may be created in conformance with specific
manpower statutes that may be enacted by the State or federal government nor to any
positions created to implement block grant actions or to implement a program reflecting
fundamental changes in federal/State relationships. Notwithstanding anything contained
in this section, BPW may authorize additional positions to meet public emergencies
resulting from an act of God and violent acts of man that are necessary to protect the health
and safety of the people of Maryland. BPW may authorize the creation of additional
positions within the Executive Branch provided that 1.25 contractual full–time equivalents
(FTE) are abolished for each regular position authorized and that there be no increase in
agency funds in the current budget and the next two subsequent budgets as the result of
this action. It is the intent of the General Assembly that priority is given to converting
– 356 –
WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 602
individuals that have been in contractual FTEs for at least two years. Any position created
by this method may not be counted within the limitation of 100 under this section. The
numerical limitation on the creation of positions by BPW established in this section may
not apply to positions entirely supported by funds from federal or other non–State sources
so long as both the appointing authority for the position and the Secretary of Budget and
Management certify for each position created under this exception that:
(1) funds are available from non–State sources for each position
established under this exception; and
(2) any positions created will be abolished in the event that non–State
funds are no longer available. The Secretary of Budget and Management shall certify and
report to the General Assembly by June 30, 2026, the status of positions created with
non–State funding sources during fiscal 2023 through 2026 under this provision as
remaining, authorized, or abolished due to the discontinuation of funds.

Section 49:
SECTION 33. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That immediately following the
close of fiscal 2025, the Secretary of Budget and Management shall determine the total
number of full–time equivalent (FTE) positions that are authorized as of the last day of
fiscal 2025 and on the first day of fiscal 2026. Authorized positions shall include all
positions authorized by the General Assembly in the personnel detail of the budgets for
fiscal 2025 and 2026, including nonbudgetary programs, the Maryland Transportation
Authority, the University System of Maryland self–supported activities, and Maryland
Correctional Enterprises. The Department of Budget and Management shall also prepare
a report during fiscal 2026 for the budget committees upon creation of regular FTE
positions through Board of Public Works action and upon transfer or abolition of positions.
It shall note, at the program level:
(1) where regular FTE positions have been abolished;
(2) where regular FTE positions have been created;
(3) from where and to where regular FTE positions have been transferred;
and
(4) where any other adjustments have been made. Provision of contractual
FTE information in the same fashion as reported in the appendices of the Governor’s Fiscal
2026 Budget Books shall also be provided.
Further provided that this report shall also be submitted as an appendix with the
Governor’s Fiscal 2027 Budget Books, and that the report shall provide information that is
consistent with information in the individual agency pages of the Budget Books and with
data provided to the Department of Legislative Services.

estimated revenues and expenditures associated with the employees’ and retirees’ health
plan. The data in this report should be consistent with the budget data submitted to the
Department of Legislative Services. This accounting shall include:
(1) any health plan receipts received from State agencies, as well as
prescription rebates or recoveries, or audit recoveries, and other miscellaneous recoveries;
(2) any health plan receipts received from employees and retirees, broken
out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees;

employees and retirees for any health, mental health, dental, or prescription plan, as well
as any administrative costs not covered by these plans, with health, mental health, and
prescription drug expenditures broken out by medical payments for active employees,
non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees, and prescription drug
expenditures broken out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and
Medicare–eligible retirees; and
(4) any balance remaining and held in reserve for future provider

Further provided that each agency or administration that funds or places children

necessary for the timely production of the report. The report shall be submitted to the
budget committees by January 1, 2026, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from

Further provided that, if DSP encounters difficulty obtaining, or validating the
accuracy of, the necessary crime data by November 1, 2025, from local jurisdictions who
provide the data for inclusion in the UCR, DSP shall notify the Governor’s Office of Crime
Prevention and Policy (GOCPP). From each jurisdiction’s third quarterly State Aid for
Police Protection (SAPP) disbursement, the office shall withhold a portion, totaling at least
15% but no more than 50%, of that jurisdiction’s SAPP grant for fiscal 2026 upon receipt of
notification from DSP. GOCPP shall withhold SAPP funds until such a time that the
jurisdiction submits its crime data to DSP, and DSP verifies the accuracy of the data. DSP
and GOCPP shall submit a report to the budget committees indicating any jurisdiction from
which crime data was not received by November 1, 2025, and the amount of SAPP funding
from each jurisdiction.

Section 53:

requirements.
The department shall establish a process to

the nonpublic schools to assure that the
nonpublic schools have appropriate access
to federal funds for which they are eligible.
Further provided that the Maryland State
– 189 –

Ch. 602 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
Department of Education shall:
(1) Assure that the process for
textbook, computer hardware, and
computer software acquisition uses
a list of qualified textbook,

(2) Receive requisitions for textbooks,
computer hardware, and computer
software to be purchased from the

discriminate against any student on the
basis of race, color, national origin, sexual
orientation, or gender identity or
expression. Nothing herein shall require
any school or institution to adopt any rule,
regulation, or policy that conflicts with its
religious or moral teachings. However, all
participating schools must agree that they
will not discriminate in student
admissions, retention, or expulsion or
otherwise discriminate against any
student on the basis of race, color, national
origin, sexual orientation, or gender
identity or expression. Any school found to

discriminate shall be required to return to
the Maryland State Department of
Education all textbooks or computer
hardware and software and other
electronically delivered learning materials
acquired through the fiscal 2025 allocation.
The only other legal remedy for violation of

identity or expression. If a
nonpublic school does not
comply with these
requirements, it shall
reimburse MSDE all
scholarship funds received
under the BOOST Program
for the 2025–2026 school
year and may not charge the
student tuition and fees
instead. The only other legal
remedy for violation of this
provision is ineligibility for

Program.
(2) MSDE shall establish procedures
for the application and award
process for scholarships for
students who are eligible for the
free or reduced–price lunch

(3) MSDE shall compile and certify a
list of applicants that ranks eligible
students by family income
expressed as a percent of the most
recent federal poverty levels.
(4) MSDE shall submit the ranked list

Governor, 2 members appointed by
the President of the Senate, 2
members appointed by the Speaker
of the House of Delegates, and 1
member jointly appointed by the
President and the Speaker to serve
as the chair. A member of the
BOOST Advisory Board may not be
an elected official and may not have
any financial interest in an eligible
nonpublic school.
(6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
review and certify the ranked list of
applicants and shall determine the
scholarship award amounts. The
BOOST Advisory Board shall take
into account the needs of students
with disabilities on an
Individualized Education Plan or
504 Plan when determining
scholarship award amounts.
(7) MSDE shall make scholarship
awards to eligible students as
determined by the BOOST Advisory
Board.
(8) Unless the student has special
needs due to a disability, the
amount of a scholarship award may
not exceed the lesser of:
(a) the statewide average per
pupil expenditure by local
education agencies, as
calculated by MSDE; or
(b) the tuition of the nonpublic
school.
(9) In order to meet its BOOST
Program reporting requirements to
– 195 –

Ch. 602 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
the budget committees, MSDE shall
specify a date by which
participating nonpublic schools
must submit information to MSDE
so that it may complete its required
report. Any nonpublic schools that
do not provide the necessary
information by that specified date
shall be ineligible to participate in
the BOOST Program.
(10) Students who received a BOOST
Program scholarship award in the
prior year who still meet eligibility
criteria for a scholarship shall

who attended public schools in the
prior school year.
Further provided that the BOOST Advisory
Board shall make all scholarship awards no
later than December 31, 2025, for the

non–State funding sources during fiscal 2023 through 2026 under this provision as
remaining, authorized, or abolished due to the discontinuation of funds.
