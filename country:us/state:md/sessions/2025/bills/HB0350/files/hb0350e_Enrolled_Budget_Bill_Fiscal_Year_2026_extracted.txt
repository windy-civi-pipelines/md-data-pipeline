15 retention, or expulsion or
16 otherwise discriminate
17 against any student on the
18 basis of race, color, national
19 origin, sexual orientation, or
20 gender identity or
21 expression. Nothing herein

24 regulation, or policy that
25 conflicts with its religious or
26 moral teachings. However,
27 all participating schools
28 must agree that they will not

4 Program.
5 (2) MSDE shall establish procedures
6 for the application and award
7 process for scholarships for

41 any financial interest in an eligible
42 nonpublic school.
HOUSE BILL 350 191
1 (6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall
2 review and certify the ranked list of

16 needs due to a disability, the
17 amount of a scholarship award may
18 not exceed the lesser of:
19 (a) the statewide average per
20 pupil expenditure by local

11 General Assembly. Incumbents in positions abolished may continue State employment in
12 another position.
13 SECTION 31. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Accounting
14 Division of the Comptroller of Maryland shall establish a subsidiary ledger control account
15 to debit all State agency funds budgeted under subobject 0175 (Workers’ Compensation)

24 than 100 positions in excess of the total number of authorized State positions on July 1,
25 2025, as determined by the Secretary of Budget and Management. Provided, however, that
26 if the imposition of this ceiling causes undue hardship in any department, agency, board,
27 or commission, additional positions may be created for that affected unit to the extent that
28 an equal number of positions authorized by the General Assembly for the fiscal year are
29 abolished in that unit or in other units of State government. It is further provided that the
30 limit of 100 does not apply to any position that may be created in conformance with specific
31 manpower statutes that may be enacted by the State or federal government nor to any
32 positions created to implement block grant actions or to implement a program reflecting
33 fundamental changes in federal/State relationships. Notwithstanding anything contained

35 resulting from an act of God and violent acts of man that are necessary to protect the health
36 and safety of the people of Maryland. BPW may authorize the creation of additional
37 positions within the Executive Branch provided that 1.25 contractual full–time equivalents
38 (FTE) are abolished for each regular position authorized and that there be no increase in
39 agency funds in the current budget and the next two subsequent budgets as the result of
40 this action. It is the intent of the General Assembly that priority is given to converting
41 individuals that have been in contractual FTEs for at least two years. Any position created
42 by this method may not be counted within the limitation of 100 under this section. The
348 HOUSE BILL 350
1 numerical limitation on the creation of positions by BPW established in this section may
2 not apply to positions entirely supported by funds from federal or other non–State sources
3 so long as both the appointing authority for the position and the Secretary of Budget and
4 Management certify for each position created under this exception that:
5 (1) funds are available from non–State sources for each position
6 established under this exception; and
7 (2) any positions created will be abolished in the event that non–State
8 funds are no longer available. The Secretary of Budget and Management shall certify and
9 report to the General Assembly by June 30, 2026, the status of positions created with
10 non–State funding sources during fiscal 2023 through 2026 under this provision as
11 remaining, authorized, or abolished due to the discontinuation of funds.
12 SECTION 33. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That immediately following the
13 close of fiscal 2025, the Secretary of Budget and Management shall determine the total
14 number of full–time equivalent (FTE) positions that are authorized as of the last day of
15 fiscal 2025 and on the first day of fiscal 2026. Authorized positions shall include all
16 positions authorized by the General Assembly in the personnel detail of the budgets for
17 fiscal 2025 and 2026, including nonbudgetary programs, the Maryland Transportation
18 Authority, the University System of Maryland self–supported activities, and Maryland
19 Correctional Enterprises. The Department of Budget and Management shall also prepare
20 a report during fiscal 2026 for the budget committees upon creation of regular FTE
21 positions through Board of Public Works action and upon transfer or abolition of positions.
22 It shall note, at the program level:
23 (1) where regular FTE positions have been abolished;
24 (2) where regular FTE positions have been created;
25 (3) from where and to where regular FTE positions have been transferred;
26 and
27 (4) where any other adjustments have been made. Provision of contractual
28 FTE information in the same fashion as reported in the appendices of the Governor’s Fiscal
29 2026 Budget Books shall also be provided.
30 Further provided that this report shall also be submitted as an appendix with the
31 Governor’s Fiscal 2027 Budget Books, and that the report shall provide information that is
32 consistent with information in the individual agency pages of the Budget Books and with
33 data provided to the Department of Legislative Services.
34 SECTION 34. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the Secretary of Budget and
35 Management shall include as an appendix in the Governor’s Fiscal 2027 Budget Books an
36 accounting of the fiscal 2025 actual, fiscal 2026 working appropriation, and fiscal 2027
37 estimated revenues and expenditures associated with the employees’ and retirees’ health
38 plan. The data in this report should be consistent with the budget data submitted to the
HOUSE BILL 350 349
1 Department of Legislative Services. This accounting shall include:
2 (1) any health plan receipts received from State agencies, as well as
3 prescription rebates or recoveries, or audit recoveries, and other miscellaneous recoveries;
4 (2) any health plan receipts received from employees and retirees, broken
5 out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees;
6 (3) any premium, capitated, or claims expenditures paid on behalf of State
7 employees and retirees for any health, mental health, dental, or prescription plan, as well
8 as any administrative costs not covered by these plans, with health, mental health, and
9 prescription drug expenditures broken out by medical payments for active employees,
10 non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees, and prescription drug
11 expenditures broken out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and
12 Medicare–eligible retirees; and

14 payments.

27 ensure that the local education agencies
28 are effectively and promptly working with
29 the nonpublic schools to assure that the
30 nonpublic schools have appropriate access
31 to federal funds for which they are eligible.
32 Further provided that the Maryland State
33 Department of Education shall:
34 (1) Assure that the process for
35 textbook, computer hardware, and
36 computer software acquisition uses
37 a list of qualified textbook,
38 computer hardware, and computer

40 textbooks, computer hardware, and
41 computer software; uses textbooks,

186 HOUSE BILL 350
1 computer hardware, and computer
2 software that are secular in
3 character and acceptable for use in
4 any public elementary or secondary
5 school in Maryland; and
6 (2) Receive requisitions for textbooks,
7 computer hardware, and computer
8 software to be purchased from the

36 Further provided that a nonpublic school
37 participating in the Aid to Non–Public
38 Schools Program R00A03.04 shall certify
39 compliance with Title 20, Subtitle 6 of the
40 State Government Article. A nonpublic
41 school participating in the program may
42 not discriminate in student admissions,

HOUSE BILL 350 187
1 retention, or expulsion, or otherwise
2 discriminate against any student on the
3 basis of race, color, national origin, sexual

7 regulation, or policy that conflicts with its
8 religious or moral teachings. However, all
9 participating schools must agree that they
10 will not discriminate in student
11 admissions, retention, or expulsion or
12 otherwise discriminate against any
13 student on the basis of race, color, national
14 origin, sexual orientation, or gender

15 retention, or expulsion or
16 otherwise discriminate
17 against any student on the
18 basis of race, color, national
19 origin, sexual orientation, or
20 gender identity or
21 expression. Nothing herein

24 regulation, or policy that
25 conflicts with its religious or
26 moral teachings. However,
27 all participating schools
28 must agree that they will not

4 Program.
5 (2) MSDE shall establish procedures
6 for the application and award

42 nonpublic school.

HOUSE BILL 350 191
1 (6) The BOOST Advisory Board shall

8 or previously found delinquent of a
9 felonious offense;
10 (3) recidivism data, including

16 least fiscal 2018 through 2024. The
17 department shall also provide
18 recidivism rates for youth who were

11 General Assembly. Incumbents in positions abolished may continue State employment in
12 another position.
13 SECTION 31. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Accounting
14 Division of the Comptroller of Maryland shall establish a subsidiary ledger control account
15 to debit all State agency funds budgeted under subobject 0175 (Workers’ Compensation)

24 than 100 positions in excess of the total number of authorized State positions on July 1,
25 2025, as determined by the Secretary of Budget and Management. Provided, however, that
26 if the imposition of this ceiling causes undue hardship in any department, agency, board,
27 or commission, additional positions may be created for that affected unit to the extent that
28 an equal number of positions authorized by the General Assembly for the fiscal year are
29 abolished in that unit or in other units of State government. It is further provided that the
30 limit of 100 does not apply to any position that may be created in conformance with specific
31 manpower statutes that may be enacted by the State or federal government nor to any
32 positions created to implement block grant actions or to implement a program reflecting
33 fundamental changes in federal/State relationships. Notwithstanding anything contained

35 resulting from an act of God and violent acts of man that are necessary to protect the health
36 and safety of the people of Maryland. BPW may authorize the creation of additional
37 positions within the Executive Branch provided that 1.25 contractual full–time equivalents
38 (FTE) are abolished for each regular position authorized and that there be no increase in
39 agency funds in the current budget and the next two subsequent budgets as the result of
40 this action. It is the intent of the General Assembly that priority is given to converting
41 individuals that have been in contractual FTEs for at least two years. Any position created
42 by this method may not be counted within the limitation of 100 under this section. The

348 HOUSE BILL 350
1 numerical limitation on the creation of positions by BPW established in this section may
2 not apply to positions entirely supported by funds from federal or other non–State sources
3 so long as both the appointing authority for the position and the Secretary of Budget and
4 Management certify for each position created under this exception that:
5 (1) funds are available from non–State sources for each position
6 established under this exception; and
7 (2) any positions created will be abolished in the event that non–State
8 funds are no longer available. The Secretary of Budget and Management shall certify and
9 report to the General Assembly by June 30, 2026, the status of positions created with
10 non–State funding sources during fiscal 2023 through 2026 under this provision as
11 remaining, authorized, or abolished due to the discontinuation of funds.
12 SECTION 33. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That immediately following the
13 close of fiscal 2025, the Secretary of Budget and Management shall determine the total
14 number of full–time equivalent (FTE) positions that are authorized as of the last day of
15 fiscal 2025 and on the first day of fiscal 2026. Authorized positions shall include all
16 positions authorized by the General Assembly in the personnel detail of the budgets for
17 fiscal 2025 and 2026, including nonbudgetary programs, the Maryland Transportation
18 Authority, the University System of Maryland self–supported activities, and Maryland
19 Correctional Enterprises. The Department of Budget and Management shall also prepare

21 positions through Board of Public Works action and upon transfer or abolition of positions.
22 It shall note, at the program level:
23 (1) where regular FTE positions have been abolished;
24 (2) where regular FTE positions have been created;
25 (3) from where and to where regular FTE positions have been transferred;
26 and
27 (4) where any other adjustments have been made. Provision of contractual
28 FTE information in the same fashion as reported in the appendices of the Governor’s Fiscal
29 2026 Budget Books shall also be provided.
30 Further provided that this report shall also be submitted as an appendix with the
31 Governor’s Fiscal 2027 Budget Books, and that the report shall provide information that is

33 data provided to the Department of Legislative Services.

36 accounting of the fiscal 2025 actual, fiscal 2026 working appropriation, and fiscal 2027
37 estimated revenues and expenditures associated with the employees’ and retirees’ health
38 plan. The data in this report should be consistent with the budget data submitted to the

5 out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees;
6 (3) any premium, capitated, or claims expenditures paid on behalf of State
7 employees and retirees for any health, mental health, dental, or prescription plan, as well
8 as any administrative costs not covered by these plans, with health, mental health, and
9 prescription drug expenditures broken out by medical payments for active employees,
10 non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and Medicare–eligible retirees, and prescription drug
11 expenditures broken out by active employees, non–Medicare–eligible retirees, and
