birth control with the enactment of the Contraceptive Equity Act of 2016; and

control through a State–regulated private plan, the Maryland Medical Assistance Program,
or the State Employee and Retiree Health and Welfare Benefits Program; and
WHEREAS, On July 13, 2023, the federal Food and Drug Administration expanded
the number of over–the–counter birth control options with the approval of the first daily
birth control pill for over–the–counter use; and
WHEREAS, Maryland can continue to lead the nation in ensuring over–the–counter
birth control access by establishing a consumer–focused implementation collaborative to
support collaboration among consumer organizations, industry stakeholders, and State
agencies; now, therefore,
