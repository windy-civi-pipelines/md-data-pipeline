2 SENATE BILL 661
1 (a) In this section, the phrase “the effective date of legislative authority for the
2 acquisition of the property” means, with respect to a condemnor vested with continuing
3 power of condemnation, the date of specific administrative determination to acquire the
4 property.
5 (b) (1) (I) [The] SUBJECT TO PARAGRAPH (2) OF THIS SUBSECTION,
6 THE fair market value of property in a condemnation proceeding is the price as of the
7 valuation date for the highest and best use of the property which a vendor, willing but not
8 obligated to sell, would accept for the property, and which a purchaser, willing but not
9 obligated to buy, would pay, excluding any increment in value proximately caused by the
10 public project for which the property condemned is needed. [In addition, fair]
11 (II) FAIR market value includes any amount by which the price
12 reflects a diminution in value occurring between the effective date of legislative authority
13 for the acquisition of the property and the date of actual taking if the trier of facts finds
14 that the diminution in value was proximately caused by the public project for which the
15 property condemned is needed, or by announcements or acts of the plaintiff or its officials
16 concerning the public project, and was beyond the reasonable control of the property owner.
17 (2) (I) THIS PARAGRAPH APPLIES ONLY TO PROPERTY THAT IS
18 ACTIVELY USED FOR FARM OR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES AS DETERMINED BY THE
19 STATE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENTS AND TAXATION UNDER § 8–209 OF THE
20 TAX – PROPERTY ARTICLE, INCLUDING PROPERTY ACQUIRED BY CONDEMNATION
21 FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OR MAINTENANCE OF A TRANSMISSION LINE UNDER §§
22 7–207 AND 7–208 OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES ARTICLE.
23 (II) THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF PROPERTY ACTIVELY USED
24 FOR FARM OR AGRICULTURAL PURPOSES IN A CONDEMNATION PROCEEDING SHALL
25 BE 350% OF THE HIGHEST APPRAISAL VALUE OF THE PROPERTY.
26 (c) The defendant property owner may elect to present as evidence in a
27 condemnation proceeding, the assessed value of the property, as determined by the
28 Department of Assessments and Taxation, if the assessed value is greater than the
29 appraised value placed on the property by the condemning authority.
30 (d) (1) [If] EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH (2) OF THIS
31 SUBSECTION, IF property is ever acquired by the exercise of the power of eminent domain,
32 the fair market value of the property is not affected by the property having been qualified
33 for a tax credit under § 9–208 of the Tax – Property Article. [However, if]
34 (2) IF the grantee of an easement purchased the easement for monetary
35 consideration other than, or in addition to, the tax credit under § 9–208 of the
36 Tax – Property Article, then the condemnation award shall be reduced by an amount equal
37 to the additional consideration.
