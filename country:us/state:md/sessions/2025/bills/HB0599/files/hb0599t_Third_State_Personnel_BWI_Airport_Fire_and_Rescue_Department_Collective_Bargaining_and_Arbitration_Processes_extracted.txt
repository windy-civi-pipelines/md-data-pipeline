12 (4) Each Budget shall embrace an estimate of all appropriations in such
13 form and detail as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law, as follows:
14 (a) for the General Assembly as certified to the Governor in the manner hereinafter
15 provided; (b) for the Executive Department; (c) for the Judiciary Department, as provided

27 (5) The Governor shall deliver to the presiding officer of each House the
28 Budget and a bill for all the proposed appropriations of the Budget classified and in such
29 form and detail as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law; and the
30 presiding officer of each House shall promptly cause said bill to be introduced therein, and
31 such bill shall be known as the “Budget Bill.” The Governor may, with the consent of the
32 General Assembly, before final action thereon by the General Assembly, amend or
33 supplement said Budget to correct an oversight, provide funds contingent on passage of
34 pending legislation or, in case of an emergency, by delivering such an amendment or
35 supplement to the presiding officers of both Houses; and such amendment or supplement
36 shall thereby become a part of said Budget Bill as an addition to the items of said bill or as
37 a modification of or a substitute for any item of said bill such amendment or supplement
38 may affect.
39 (5a) The Budget and the Budget Bill as submitted by the Governor to the
40 General Assembly shall have a figure for the total of all proposed appropriations and a
41 figure for the total of all estimated revenues available to pay the appropriations, and the
42 figure for total proposed appropriations shall not exceed the figure for total estimated

8 HOUSE BILL 599
1 Bill nor the General Assembly in amending the Budget Bill shall thereby cause the figure

3 including any revisions, and in the Budget Bill as enacted the figure for total estimated
4 revenues always shall be equal to or exceed the figure for total appropriations.
5 (6) The General Assembly shall not amend the Budget Bill so as to affect

7 provisions made by the laws of the State for the establishment and maintenance of a system
8 of public schools or the payment of any salaries required to be paid by the State of Maryland

10 (6a) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill each fiscal year as required under
11 this Section, the General Assembly may amend the bill by increasing or diminishing the

14 except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary or
15 compensation of any public officer may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of
16 office. When passed by both Houses, the Budget Bill shall be presented to the Governor for
17 approval or disapproval according to Section 17 of Article II of this Constitution.
18 (6b) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill as required under this Section for
19 fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Assembly may amend the bill
20 by increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the General Assembly, by
21 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the judiciary, and by
22 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the Executive Department,
23 provided that the total of the appropriation for the Executive Department approved by the
24 General Assembly does not exceed the total proposed appropriation for the Executive
25 Department submitted by the Governor. The salary or compensation of any public officer
26 may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of office. When passed by both Houses,
27 the Budget Bill shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.
28 (7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments,
29 boards, officers and commissions of the State expending or applying for State’s moneys, as

31 requested by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be
32 heard with respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer
33 inquiries relative thereto.
34 (8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
35 appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
36 the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other
37 appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the provisions following: (a) Every
38 such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
39 or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
40 Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
41 appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
42 be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless
HOUSE BILL 599 9
1 it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
2 elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
3 Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
4 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
5 apply.
6 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General
7 Assembly from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of
8 Article 3 of the Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in
9 Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment
10 of any obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the
11 Constitution of the United States.
12 (10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the
13 Legislature seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue
14 a proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
15 judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
16 be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
17 (11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require
18 from the proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and
19 administrative offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise
20 the expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
21 itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
22 the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
23 effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
24 the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
25 in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
26 of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
27 Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
28 transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
29 and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
30 (12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
31 require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all
32 institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
33 the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary
34 departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
35 may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
36 which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
37 before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
38 (13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
39 inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
40 (14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this
41 Section and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section
10 HOUSE BILL 599
1 shall prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of
2 Article 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance
3 thereof, or be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of
4 the General Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General
5 Assembly at such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
6 appropriations.
7 (15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this
8 Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
9 of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.
10 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Assembly
11 determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
12 Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland
13 Constitution concerning local approval of constitutional amendments do not apply.
14 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:
15 (a) The amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this

20 Constitution shall be by ballot, and on each ballot there shall be printed the words “For the
21 Constitutional Amendment” and “Against the Constitutional Amendment”, as now
22 provided by law.
23 (2) At that general election, a question substantially similar to the
24 following shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State:
25 “Question ____ – Constitutional Amendment
26 Providing that each budget shall include expenditures necessary to implement
27 wages, hours, fringe benefits, health benefits, and other terms and conditions of
28 employment for State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding
29 covering State employees.”.
30 (c) Immediately after the election, all returns shall be made to the Governor of
31 the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
32 Maryland Constitution, and further proceedings had in accordance with Article XIV.
33 SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect July
34 1, 2025.
HOUSE BILL 599 11
1 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That Section 1 of this Act is
2 contingent on the passage of Section 2 of this Act, a constitutional amendment, and its
3 ratification by voters of the State.
4 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That, subject to Section 5 of this
5 Act, Section 1 of this Act shall take effect on the proclamation of the Governor that the

27 (5) The Governor shall deliver to the presiding officer of each House the

29 form and detail as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law; and the
30 presiding officer of each House shall promptly cause said bill to be introduced therein, and

34 pending legislation or, in case of an emergency, by delivering such an amendment or
35 supplement to the presiding officers of both Houses; and such amendment or supplement
36 shall thereby become a part of said Budget Bill as an addition to the items of said bill or as

38 may affect.
39 (5a) The Budget and the Budget Bill as submitted by the Governor to the
40 General Assembly shall have a figure for the total of all proposed appropriations and a

8 HOUSE BILL 599
1 Bill nor the General Assembly in amending the Budget Bill shall thereby cause the figure
2 for total proposed appropriations to exceed the figure for total estimated revenues,
3 including any revisions, and in the Budget Bill as enacted the figure for total estimated
4 revenues always shall be equal to or exceed the figure for total appropriations.
5 (6) The General Assembly shall not amend the Budget Bill so as to affect
6 either the obligations of the State under Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution, or the
7 provisions made by the laws of the State for the establishment and maintenance of a system
8 of public schools or the payment of any salaries required to be paid by the State of Maryland
9 by the Constitution.
10 (6a) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill each fiscal year as required under
11 this Section, the General Assembly may amend the bill by increasing or diminishing the
12 items therein relating to the General Assembly, and by increasing or diminishing the items
13 therein relating to the judiciary, but except as hereinbefore specified, may not alter the bill
14 except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary or
15 compensation of any public officer may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of
16 office. When passed by both Houses, the Budget Bill shall be presented to the Governor for
17 approval or disapproval according to Section 17 of Article II of this Constitution.
18 (6b) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill as required under this Section for
19 fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Assembly may amend the bill
20 by increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the General Assembly, by
21 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the judiciary, and by
22 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the Executive Department,
23 provided that the total of the appropriation for the Executive Department approved by the
24 General Assembly does not exceed the total proposed appropriation for the Executive
25 Department submitted by the Governor. The salary or compensation of any public officer
26 may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of office. When passed by both Houses,
27 the Budget Bill shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.
28 (7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments,
29 boards, officers and commissions of the State expending or applying for State’s moneys, as
30 have been designated by the Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when
31 requested by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be
32 heard with respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer
33 inquiries relative thereto.
34 (8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
35 appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
36 the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other
37 appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the provisions following: (a) Every
38 such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
39 or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
40 Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
41 appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
42 be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless

HOUSE BILL 599 9
1 it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
2 elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
3 Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
4 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
5 apply.
6 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General
7 Assembly from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of
8 Article 3 of the Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in
9 Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment
10 of any obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the
11 Constitution of the United States.
12 (10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the
13 Legislature seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue
14 a proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
15 judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
16 be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
17 (11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require
18 from the proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and
19 administrative offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise
20 the expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
21 itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
22 the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
23 effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
24 the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
25 in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
26 of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
27 Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
28 transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
29 and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
30 (12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
31 require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all
32 institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
33 the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary
34 departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
35 may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
36 which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
37 before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
38 (13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
39 inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
40 (14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this
41 Section and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section

10 HOUSE BILL 599
1 shall prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of
2 Article 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance
3 thereof, or be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of
4 the General Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General
5 Assembly at such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
6 appropriations.
7 (15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this
8 Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
9 of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.
10 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Assembly
11 determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
12 Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland
13 Constitution concerning local approval of constitutional amendments do not apply.
14 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:
15 (a) The amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
16 Act shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State at the next general election to be
17 held in November 2026 for adoption or rejection in accordance with Article XIV of the
18 Maryland Constitution.
19 (b) (1) At that general election, the vote on the proposed amendment to the
20 Constitution shall be by ballot, and on each ballot there shall be printed the words “For the
21 Constitutional Amendment” and “Against the Constitutional Amendment”, as now
22 provided by law.
23 (2) At that general election, a question substantially similar to the
24 following shall be submitted to the qualified voters of the State:
25 “Question ____ – Constitutional Amendment
26 Providing that each budget shall include expenditures necessary to implement
27 wages, hours, fringe benefits, health benefits, and other terms and conditions of
28 employment for State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding
29 covering State employees.”.
30 (c) Immediately after the election, all returns shall be made to the Governor of
31 the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
32 Maryland Constitution, and further proceedings had in accordance with Article XIV.
33 SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect July
34 1, 2025.

HOUSE BILL 599 11
1 SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That Section 1 of this Act is
2 contingent on the passage of Section 2 of this Act, a constitutional amendment, and its
3 ratification by voters of the State.
4 SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That, subject to Section 5 of this
5 Act, Section 1 of this Act shall take effect on the proclamation of the Governor that the
6 constitutional amendment, having received a majority of the votes cast at the general
7 election, has been adopted by the people of Maryland.
