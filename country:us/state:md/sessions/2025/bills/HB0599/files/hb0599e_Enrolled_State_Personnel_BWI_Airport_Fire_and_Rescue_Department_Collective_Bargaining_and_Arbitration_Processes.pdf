43 pending legislation or, in case of an emergency, by delivering such an amendment or

8 HOUSE BILL 599
1 supplement to the presiding officers of both Houses; and such amendment or supplement

6 General Assembly shall have a figure for the total of all proposed appropriations and a
7 figure for the total of all estimated revenues available to pay the appropriations, and the
8 figure for total proposed appropriations shall not exceed the figure for total estimated

17 of public schools or the payment of any salaries required to be paid by the State of Maryland

23 except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary or
24 compensation of any public officer may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of
25 office. When passed by both Houses, the Budget Bill shall be presented to the Governor for
26 approval or disapproval according to Section 17 of Article II of this Constitution.
27 (6b) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill as required under this Section for
28 fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Assembly may amend the bill
29 by increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the General Assembly, by
30 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the judiciary, and by
31 increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the Executive Department,
32 provided that the total of the appropriation for the Executive Department approved by the
33 General Assembly does not exceed the total proposed appropriation for the Executive
34 Department submitted by the Governor. The salary or compensation of any public officer
35 may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of office. When passed by both Houses,
36 the Budget Bill shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.
37 (7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments,
38 boards, officers and commissions of the State expending or applying for State’s moneys, as
39 have been designated by the Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when
40 requested by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be
41 heard with respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer
42 inquiries relative thereto.

HOUSE BILL 599 9
1 (8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
2 appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
3 the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other

5 such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
6 or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
7 Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
8 appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
9 be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless
10 it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
11 elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
12 Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
13 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
14 apply.
15 (9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General
16 Assembly from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of
17 Article 3 of the Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in
18 Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment
19 of any obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the
20 Constitution of the United States.
21 (10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the
22 Legislature seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue
23 a proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
24 judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
25 be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
26 (11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require
27 from the proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and
28 administrative offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise
29 the expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
30 itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
31 the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
32 effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
33 the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
34 in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
35 of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
36 Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
37 transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
38 and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
39 (12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
40 require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all
41 institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
42 the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary

10 HOUSE BILL 599
1 departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
2 may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
3 which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
4 before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
5 (13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
6 inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
7 (14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this
8 Section and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section
9 shall prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of
10 Article 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance
11 thereof, or be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of
12 the General Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General
13 Assembly at such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
14 appropriations.
15 (15) If any item of any appropriation bill passed under the provisions of this
16 Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
17 of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.
18 SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the General Assembly
19 determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
20 Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland
21 Constitution concerning local approval of constitutional amendments do not apply.
22 SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That:

34 Providing that each budget shall include expenditures necessary to implement
35 wages, hours, fringe benefits, health benefits, and other terms and conditions of
36 employment for State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding
37 covering State employees.”.

2 the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
