Treasury except in accordance with the provisions of this section.
(2) Every appropriation bill shall be either a Budget Bill, or a
Supplementary Appropriation Bill, as hereinafter provided.
(3) On the third Wednesday in January in each year, (except in the case of
a newly elected Governor, and then not later than ten days after the convening of the
General Assembly), unless such time shall be extended by the General Assembly, the
Governor shall submit to the General Assembly a Budget for the next ensuing fiscal year.
Each Budget shall contain a complete plan of proposed expenditures and estimated
revenues for said fiscal year and shall show the estimated surplus or deficit of revenues at
the end of the preceding fiscal year. EACH BUDGET SHALL ALSO CONTAIN THE
APPROPRIATIONS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
EMPLOYMENT IN EACH MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING CONCLUDED WITH THE
STATE, WHETHER REACHED THROUGH MUTUAL AGREEMENT OR ARBITRATION
THAT IS BINDING ON THE PARTIES, AND THE GOVERNOR FOR THE NEXT ENSUING
FISCAL YEAR FOR THE UNIFORMED FIRE EMPLOYEES OF THE BWI AIRPORT FIRE
AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT. Accompanying each Budget shall be a statement showing:

liabilities, reserves and surplus or deficit of the State; (c) the debts and funds of the State;

WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 654
(4) Each Budget shall embrace an estimate of all appropriations in such
form and detail as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law, as follows:
(a) for the General Assembly as certified to the Governor in the manner hereinafter
provided; (b) for the Executive Department; (c) for the Judiciary Department, as provided
by law, as certified to the Governor; (d) to pay and discharge the principal and interest of

laws enacted in pursuance thereof; (e) for the salaries AND, FOR THE UNIFORMED FIRE
EMPLOYEES OF THE BWI AIRPORT FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT, FRINGE
BENEFITS payable by the State and under the Constitution and laws of the State,
INCLUDING THOSE SALARIES AND BENEFITS COMMITTED UNDER EACH
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING COVERING THE UNIFORMED FIRE EMPLOYEES
OF THE BWI AIRPORT FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT; (f) for the establishment and

Budget and a bill for all the proposed appropriations of the Budget classified and in such
form and detail as the Governor shall determine or as may be prescribed by law; and the
presiding officer of each House shall promptly cause said bill to be introduced therein, and
such bill shall be known as the “Budget Bill.” The Governor may, with the consent of the
General Assembly, before final action thereon by the General Assembly, amend or
supplement said Budget to correct an oversight, provide funds contingent on passage of
pending legislation or, in case of an emergency, by delivering such an amendment or
supplement to the presiding officers of both Houses; and such amendment or supplement

may affect.

General Assembly shall have a figure for the total of all proposed appropriations and a
figure for the total of all estimated revenues available to pay the appropriations, and the
figure for total proposed appropriations shall not exceed the figure for total estimated
revenues. Neither the Governor in submitting an amendment or supplement to the Budget
Bill nor the General Assembly in amending the Budget Bill shall thereby cause the figure
for total proposed appropriations to exceed the figure for total estimated revenues,
including any revisions, and in the Budget Bill as enacted the figure for total estimated
revenues always shall be equal to or exceed the figure for total appropriations.
(6) The General Assembly shall not amend the Budget Bill so as to affect
either the obligations of the State under Section 34 of Article III of the Constitution, or the
provisions made by the laws of the State for the establishment and maintenance of a system
of public schools or the payment of any salaries required to be paid by the State of Maryland
by the Constitution.
– 7 –

Ch. 654 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
(6a) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill each fiscal year as required under
this Section, the General Assembly may amend the bill by increasing or diminishing the
items therein relating to the General Assembly, and by increasing or diminishing the items
therein relating to the judiciary, but except as hereinbefore specified, may not alter the bill
except to strike out or reduce items therein, provided, however, that the salary or
compensation of any public officer may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of
office. When passed by both Houses, the Budget Bill shall be presented to the Governor for
approval or disapproval according to Section 17 of Article II of this Constitution.
(6b) In enacting a balanced Budget Bill as required under this Section for
fiscal year 2024 and each fiscal year thereafter, the General Assembly may amend the bill
by increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the General Assembly, by
increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the judiciary, and by
increasing, diminishing, or adding items therein relating to the Executive Department,
provided that the total of the appropriation for the Executive Department approved by the
General Assembly does not exceed the total proposed appropriation for the Executive
Department submitted by the Governor. The salary or compensation of any public officer
may not be decreased during the public officer’s term of office. When passed by both Houses,
the Budget Bill shall be a law immediately without further action by the Governor.
(7) The Governor and such representatives of the executive departments,
boards, officers and commissions of the State expending or applying for State’s moneys, as
have been designated by the Governor for this purpose, shall have the right, and when
requested by either House of the General Assembly, it shall be their duty to appear and be
heard with respect to any Budget Bill during the consideration thereof, and to answer
inquiries relative thereto.
(8) Supplementary Appropriation Bill. Either House may consider other
appropriations but both Houses shall not finally act upon such appropriations until after
the Budget Bill has been finally acted upon by both Houses, and no such other
appropriation shall be valid except in accordance with the provisions following: (a) Every
such appropriation shall be embodied in a separate bill limited to some single work, object
or purpose therein stated and called herein a Supplementary Appropriation Bill; (b) Each
Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall provide the revenue necessary to pay the
appropriation thereby made by a tax, direct or indirect, to be levied and collected as shall
be directed in said bill; (c) No Supplementary Appropriation Bill shall become a law unless
it be passed in each House by a vote of a majority of the whole number of the members
elected, and the yeas and nays recorded on its final passage; (d) Each Supplementary
Appropriation Bill shall be presented to the Governor of the State as provided in Section
17 of Article 2 of the Constitution and thereafter all the provisions of said section shall
apply.
(9) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing the General
Assembly from passing at any time, in accordance with the provisions of Section 28 of
Article 3 of the Constitution and subject to the Governor’s power of approval as provided in
Section 17 of Article 2 of the Constitution, an appropriation bill to provide for the payment
– 8 –

WES MOORE, Governor Ch. 654
of any obligation of the State within the protection of Section 10 of Article 1 of the
Constitution of the United States.
(10) If the Budget Bill shall not have been finally acted upon by the
Legislature seven days before the expiration of the regular session, the Governor shall issue
a proclamation extending the session for some further period as may, in the Governor’s
judgment, be necessary for the passage of such bill; but no matter other than such bill shall
be considered during such extended session except a provision for the cost thereof.
(11) For the purpose of making up the Budget, the Governor shall require
from the proper State officials (including all executive departments, all executive and
administrative offices, bureaus, boards, commissions and agencies that expend or supervise
the expenditure of, and all institutions applying, for State moneys and appropriations) such
itemized estimates and other information, in such form and at such times as directed by
the Governor. An estimate for a program required to be funded by a law which will be in
effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget and which was enacted before July 1 of
the fiscal year prior to that date shall provide a level of funding not less than that prescribed
in the law. The estimates for the Legislative Department, certified by the presiding officer
of each House, of the Judiciary, as provided by law, certified by the Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court of Maryland, and for the public schools, as provided by law, shall be
transmitted to the Governor, in such form and at such times as directed by the Governor,
and shall be included in the Budget without revision.
(12) The Governor may provide for public hearings on all estimates and may
require the attendance at such hearings of representatives of all agencies, and for all
institutions applying for State moneys. After such public hearings the Governor may, in
the Governor’s discretion, revise all estimates except those for the legislative and judiciary
departments, and for the public schools, as provided by law, and except that the Governor
may not reduce an estimate for a program below a level of funding prescribed by a law
which will be in effect during the fiscal year covered by the Budget, and which was enacted
before July 1 of the fiscal year prior thereto.
(13) The General Assembly may, from time to time, enact such laws not
inconsistent with this section, as may be necessary and proper to carry out its provisions.
(14) In the event of any inconsistency between any of the provisions of this
Section and any of the other provisions of the Constitution, the provisions of this Section
shall prevail. But nothing herein shall in any manner affect the provisions of Section 34 of
Article 3 of the Constitution or of any laws heretofore or hereafter passed in pursuance
thereof, or be construed as preventing the Governor from calling extraordinary sessions of
the General Assembly, as provided by Section 16 of Article 2, or as preventing the General
Assembly at such extraordinary sessions from considering any emergency appropriation or
appropriations.
– 9 –

Ch. 654 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND

Section shall be held invalid upon any ground, such invalidity shall not affect the legality
of the bill or of any other item of such bill or bills.

determines that the amendment to the Maryland Constitution proposed by Section 2 of this
Act affects multiple jurisdictions and that the provisions of Article XIV, § 1 of the Maryland

employment for State employees concluded in each memorandum of understanding
covering State employees.”.
(c) Immediately after the election, all returns shall be made to the Governor of
the vote for and against the proposed amendment, as directed by Article XIV of the
Maryland Constitution, and further proceedings had in accordance with Article XIV.
SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect July
1, 2025.
SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That Section 1 of this Act is
contingent on the passage of Section 2 of this Act, a constitutional amendment, and its
ratification by voters of the State.
SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That, subject to Section 5 of this
Act, Section 1 of this Act shall take effect on the proclamation of the Governor that the
