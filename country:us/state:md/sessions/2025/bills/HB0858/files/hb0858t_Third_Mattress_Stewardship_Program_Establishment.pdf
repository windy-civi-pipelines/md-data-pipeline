23 Preamble
24 WHEREAS, In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 20 million
25 mattress units are disposed of annually and that fewer than 5% are recycled; and
26 WHEREAS, Mattresses deplete limited landfill space, create flammable air pockets,
27 damage equipment used at landfills, contribute to air pollution when incinerated or
28 disposed of in a landfill, contain nonbiodegradable synthetic foam and fibers and hazardous
29 flame–retardant chemicals that can leach into the drinking water, and contribute to
30 roadside litter when dumped illegally; and
31 WHEREAS, Mattresses pose practical challenges inherent to disposal because
32 mattresses are bulky and not easily compacted, making transport and disposal inefficient;
33 and
34 WHEREAS, Programs to address the disposal of mattresses that are good for the
35 environment and good for the economy have been implemented successfully in other
36 jurisdictions, including programs implemented through nonprofit organizations with
37 expertise in social enterprises; and

HOUSE BILL 858 3
1 WHEREAS, Since 2013, California, Connecticut, Oregon, and Rhode Island have
2 implemented successful mattress stewardship programs that have recycled 15 million
3 mattresses and diverted more than 563 million pounds of steel, foam, cotton, and wood from
4 disposal, saving more than 7.5 billion gallons of water; and
5 WHEREAS, There are existing mattress recyclers in the State of Maryland who
6 manage mattress collection and reuse and recycling programs on behalf of local
7 government, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and individuals; and
8 WHEREAS, Under Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, Maryland has committed to
9 sustainable materials management practices, which use and manage materials as
10 efficiently and sustainably as possible; and
11 WHEREAS, According to Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, through source reduction,
12 reuse, and recycling, Maryland can extend existing disposal capacity, reduce the need to
13 construct new or expanded solid waste disposal facilities, conserve natural resources, and
14 support a productive economy through recovery of valuable resources; and
15 WHEREAS, According to Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, studies have shown that
16 diverting materials from disposal to reuse, recycling, and composting results in more jobs
17 and a more sustainable economy; and
18 WHEREAS, Executive Order 01.01.2017.13 establishes as the policy of the State that
19 solid waste and recycling should seek, among other things, to minimize the environmental
20 impacts of materials management over the materials’ entire life cycles; and
21 WHEREAS, Implementing policies for mattresses is consistent with existing State
22 policy; and
23 WHEREAS, Providing examples of mattress recycling to Maryland communities
24 enables the consideration of environmental, economic, and social benefits in addressing the
25 disposal, collection, deconstruction, reuse, and recycling of mattresses; now, therefore,
