17 Preamble
18 WHEREAS, In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 20 million
19 mattress units are disposed of annually and that fewer than 5% are recycled; and
20 WHEREAS, Mattresses deplete limited landfill space, create flammable air pockets,
21 damage equipment used at landfills, contribute to air pollution when incinerated or
22 disposed of in a landfill, contain nonbiodegradable synthetic foam and fibers and hazardous
23 flame–retardant chemicals that can leach into the drinking water, and contribute to
24 roadside litter when dumped illegally; and
25 WHEREAS, Mattresses pose practical challenges inherent to disposal because
26 mattresses are bulky and not easily compacted, making transport and disposal inefficient;
27 and
28 WHEREAS, Programs to address the disposal of mattresses that are good for the
29 environment and good for the economy have been implemented successfully in other
30 jurisdictions, including programs implemented through nonprofit organizations with
31 expertise in social enterprises; and
32 WHEREAS, Since 2013, California, Connecticut, Oregon, and Rhode Island have
33 implemented successful mattress stewardship programs that have recycled 15 million
34 mattresses and diverted more than 563 million pounds of steel, foam, cotton, and wood from
35 disposal, saving more than 7.5 billion gallons of water; and
36 WHEREAS, There are existing mattress recyclers in the State of Maryland who
37 manage mattress collection and reuse and recycling programs on behalf of local
38 government, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and individuals; and
HOUSE BILL 858 3
1 WHEREAS, Under Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, Maryland has committed to
2 sustainable materials management practices, which use and manage materials as
3 efficiently and sustainably as possible; and
4 WHEREAS, According to Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, through source reduction,
5 reuse, and recycling, Maryland can extend existing disposal capacity, reduce the need to
6 construct new or expanded solid waste disposal facilities, conserve natural resources, and
7 support a productive economy through recovery of valuable resources; and
8 WHEREAS, According to Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, studies have shown that
9 diverting materials from disposal to reuse, recycling, and composting results in more jobs
10 and a more sustainable economy; and
11 WHEREAS, Executive Order 01.01.2017.13 establishes as the policy of the State that
12 solid waste and recycling should seek, among other things, to minimize the environmental
13 impacts of materials management over the materials’ entire life cycles; and
14 WHEREAS, Implementing policies for mattresses is consistent with existing State
15 policy; and
16 WHEREAS, Providing examples of mattress recycling to Maryland communities
17 enables the consideration of environmental, economic, and social benefits in addressing the
18 disposal, collection, deconstruction, reuse, and recycling of mattresses; now, therefore,

15 Annotated Code of Maryland
16 (2014 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
17 Preamble
18 WHEREAS, In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 20 million
19 mattress units are disposed of annually and that fewer than 5% are recycled; and
20 WHEREAS, Mattresses deplete limited landfill space, create flammable air pockets,
21 damage equipment used at landfills, contribute to air pollution when incinerated or
22 disposed of in a landfill, contain nonbiodegradable synthetic foam and fibers and hazardous
23 flame–retardant chemicals that can leach into the drinking water, and contribute to
24 roadside litter when dumped illegally; and
25 WHEREAS, Mattresses pose practical challenges inherent to disposal because
26 mattresses are bulky and not easily compacted, making transport and disposal inefficient;
27 and
28 WHEREAS, Programs to address the disposal of mattresses that are good for the
29 environment and good for the economy have been implemented successfully in other
30 jurisdictions, including programs implemented through nonprofit organizations with
31 expertise in social enterprises; and
32 WHEREAS, Since 2013, California, Connecticut, Oregon, and Rhode Island have
33 implemented successful mattress stewardship programs that have recycled 15 million
34 mattresses and diverted more than 563 million pounds of steel, foam, cotton, and wood from
35 disposal, saving more than 7.5 billion gallons of water; and
36 WHEREAS, There are existing mattress recyclers in the State of Maryland who
37 manage mattress collection and reuse and recycling programs on behalf of local
38 government, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, and individuals; and

HOUSE BILL 858 3
1 WHEREAS, Under Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, Maryland has committed to
2 sustainable materials management practices, which use and manage materials as
3 efficiently and sustainably as possible; and
4 WHEREAS, According to Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, through source reduction,
5 reuse, and recycling, Maryland can extend existing disposal capacity, reduce the need to
6 construct new or expanded solid waste disposal facilities, conserve natural resources, and
7 support a productive economy through recovery of valuable resources; and
8 WHEREAS, According to Executive Order 01.01.2017.13, studies have shown that
9 diverting materials from disposal to reuse, recycling, and composting results in more jobs
10 and a more sustainable economy; and
11 WHEREAS, Executive Order 01.01.2017.13 establishes as the policy of the State that
12 solid waste and recycling should seek, among other things, to minimize the environmental
13 impacts of materials management over the materials’ entire life cycles; and
14 WHEREAS, Implementing policies for mattresses is consistent with existing State
15 policy; and
16 WHEREAS, Providing examples of mattress recycling to Maryland communities
17 enables the consideration of environmental, economic, and social benefits in addressing the
18 disposal, collection, deconstruction, reuse, and recycling of mattresses; now, therefore,
