1 (a) (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection and

3 whether pendente lite or permanent, the court shall use the child support guidelines set
4 forth in this subtitle.
5 (2) (i) There is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child
6 support which would result from the application of the child support guidelines set forth in
7 this subtitle is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.
8 (ii) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the
9 application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.
10 (iii) In determining whether the application of the guidelines would
11 be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court may consider:
12 1. the terms of any existing separation or property
13 settlement agreement or court order, including:
14 A. any provisions for payment of mortgages [or], marital

30 parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly
31 contributing.

33 guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court shall make a

SENATE BILL 195 23
1 written finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the
2 guidelines.
3 2. The court’s finding shall state:
4 A. the amount of child support that would have been required
5 under the guidelines;
6 B. how the order varies from the guidelines;
7 C. how the finding serves the best interests of the child WHO
8 IS THE SUBJECT OF THE ORDER; and
9 D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a
10 portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items
11 conveyed.
12 12–204.
13 (a) (1) The basic child support obligation shall be determined in accordance
14 with the schedule of basic child support obligations in subsection (e) of this section. The
15 basic child support obligation shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their
16 adjusted actual incomes.
17 (2) (i) If one or both parents have made a request for alimony or
18 maintenance in the proceeding in which a child support award is sought, the court shall
19 decide the issue and amount of alimony or maintenance before determining the child
20 support obligation under these guidelines.
21 (ii) If the court awards alimony or maintenance, the amount of
22 alimony or maintenance awarded shall be considered actual income for the recipient of the
23 alimony or maintenance and shall be subtracted from the income of the payor of the alimony
24 or maintenance under [§ 12–201(c)(2)] § 12–201(C)(1)(II) of this subtitle before the court
25 determines the amount of a child support award.
26 (3) THE AMOUNT OF THE DEDUCTION FOR THE SUPPORT OF
27 ADDITIONAL CHILDREN LIVING IN A PARENT’S HOME UNDER §
28 12–201(C)(1)(III) OF THIS SUBTITLE SHALL BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE PARENT’S
