6 emotional manipulation or abuse, or sharing inappropriate information.
7 (2) The workgroup shall review the definition of boundary–violating

28 and recreational sports leagues and teams.
29 (2) The workgroup shall review the definition of youth–serving
30 organization to determine whether it is sufficiently precise, specific, and unambiguous to
31 be clearly understood by an organization that would be subject to potential hiring and
32 registration requirements that the organization is subject to those requirements.
33 (3) If the workgroup does not find that the definition of youth–serving
34 organization set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection is sufficiently precise, specific, and

18 SENATE BILL 770
1 unambiguous, the workgroup shall recommend a definition of youth–serving organization
2 that meets the criteria in paragraph (1) of this subsection, if possible.
3 (4) The workgroup shall examine the impact on youth–serving
