1 future use by the plaintiff of the part taken. The severance or resulting damages shall be
2 diminished to the extent of the value of the special (particular) benefits to the remainder
3 arising from the plaintiff’s future use of the part taken.
4 (c) For the purpose of determining the extent of the taking and the valuation of
5 the tenant’s interest in a condemnation proceeding, no improvement or installation which
6 otherwise would be deemed part of the land shall be deemed personal property so as to be
7 excluded from the taking solely because of the private right of a tenant, as against the
8 owner of any other interest in the land sought to be condemned, to remove the improvement
9 or installation, unless the tenant exercises his right to remove it prior to the date when his
10 answer is due, or states in his answer his election to exercise this right.
11 (d) The damages to be awarded for the taking of a structure, such as a church or
12 place of religious worship, held in fee simple, or under a lease renewable forever, by or for
13 the benefit of a religious body and regularly used by the religious body, are the cost of
14 reproducing or replacing the improvements, adjusted for physical and functional
15 depreciation, to which shall be added the fair market value of the land.
16 (e) (1) The damages to be awarded for the taking of all land owned and
17 designated by a public body as park land, open space, or recreation area is the fair market
18 value as of the valuation date, of other land substantially similar in size and character and
19 of comparable quality for park, open space, or recreational purposes for the community
20 which made use of the land to be taken. No damages may be awarded unless other land is
21 acquired for park, open space, or recreational purposes. No awarded damages may be less
22 than the fair market value of the land to be taken.
23 (2) The damages to be awarded for the taking of part of the park land, open
24 space, or recreation area is the fair market value of the part taken, but not less than the
25 actual value of the replacement land as defined in paragraph (1) of this subsection plus any
26 severance or resulting damages to the remaining land by reason of the taking and of the
27 future use by the plaintiff of the part taken. The severance or resulting damages are to be
28 diminished to the extent of the value of the special (particular) benefits to the remainder
29 arising from the plaintiff’s future use of the land taken.
30 (3) Where the land, or any part of it, taken pursuant to this subsection
31 contains improvements, the damages to be awarded, in addition to that provided for in
32 paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, shall include the reasonable cost as of the
33 valuation date of providing new improvements of substantially the same size, comparable
34 character, and for the same purpose as those taken.
35 (f) The damages to be awarded for the taking of land or an interest in land over
36 which an easement in gross or other right to restrict its use has been granted pursuant to
37 § 2–504 of the Agriculture Article shall be as provided for in this subsection and § 2–515 of
38 the Agriculture Article:

40 market value after deducting the lesser of (a) the value of the easement granted, or (b) the

2 property if the easement had not been granted above the aggregate amount of property
3 taxes actually paid on the property since the easement was granted.
4 (2) The damages to be awarded where part of a tract of land is taken is the
5 fair market value of the part taken less the deduction computed as described in paragraph
6 (1) of this subsection, but not less than the actual value of the part taken less the deduction
7 computed as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection, plus any severance or resulting
8 damages to the remaining land by reason of the taking and of future use by the plaintiff of
9 the part taken.
10 (g) If any easement in gross or other right to restrict use of land or any interest
11 in land has been donated to the Maryland Historical Trust or the Maryland Environmental
12 Trust, damages shall be awarded in any condemnation proceedings under this title to the
13 fee owner and leasehold owner, as their interests may appear, and shall be the fair market
14 value of the land or interest in it, computed as though the easement or other right did not
15 exist.
