2 HOUSE BILL 1168
1 WHEREAS, The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission service rate for water
2 is required to have a minimum or a ready to serve charge under § 25–502(a) of the Public
3 Utilities Article; and
4 WHEREAS, The ready to serve charge consists of two components: an account
5 maintenance fee and an infrastructure investment fee; and
6 WHEREAS, The Attorney General stated in 2008 that the Washington Suburban
7 Sanitary Commission has the authority to adopt an infrastructure investment fee in
8 addition to an account maintenance fee; and
9 WHEREAS, The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission adopted an
10 infrastructure investment fee effective July 1, 2015; and
11 WHEREAS, Due to fire code requirements enacted by Montgomery County and
12 Prince George’s County for sprinkler systems in certain homes, a small number of
13 residential homes in the sanitary district are required to receive 1.5–inch meters to
14 accommodate the water flow of the required sprinkler systems; and
15 WHEREAS, Current law requires the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission
16 to set the ready to serve charge based on meter size and not by customer class such as
17 residential, commercial, or industrial; and
18 WHEREAS, As a result, residential customers with 1.5–inch meters pay almost
19 seven times the amount of the ready to serve charge paid by other residential customers
20 because of the statutory requirement that this charge be based on meter size; and
21 WHEREAS, The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission desires to correct this
22 inequity by seeking the authority to create customer classes within any given meter size
23 for the ready to serve charge; now, therefore,
24 WHEREAS, Under current law, the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission
25 must establish rates and charges that are uniform throughout the sanitary district; and
26 WHEREAS, Other Maryland water and sewer providers, such as the providers in
27 Baltimore City, Howard County, and the City of Rockville, have the authority to establish
28 rates and charges by customer classes; and
29 WHEREAS, The Commission has been reviewing and considering alternative rate
30 structures over the last several years; and
31 WHEREAS, During the review of other alternative rate structures, the Commission
32 has noted that the vast majority of public water and sewer providers across the country
33 similar in size and structure to the Commission have the authority to establish rates and
34 charges by customer classes; and

HOUSE BILL 1168 3
1 WHEREAS, Establishing rates and charges by class allows for a more equitable
2 recovery of costs from customers, based on the demands that they place on the water and
3 sewer systems; and
4 WHEREAS, The authority of the Commission to establish rates or charges by
5 customer classes includes establishing classes by meter size and also the ability to establish
6 a surcharge on residential customers in the summer to encourage water conservation; and
7 WHEREAS, The American Water Works Association’s Manual of Practice M–1
8 “Principles of Water Rates, Fees and Charges, Seventh Edition” and the Water
9 Environment Federation’s Manual of Practice No. 27 “Financing and Charges for
10 Wastewater Systems”, the industry’s best practices manuals, include multiple examples of
11 class–based rates, fees, and charges; now, therefore,
12 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
13 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
14 Article – Public Utilities
15 25–501.
16 (a) IN THIS SECTION, “CLASS” INCLUDES A CLASS BASED ON THE SIZE OF

20 (1) maintaining, repairing, and operating its water supply and sewer
21 systems, including the overhead expense and depreciation allowance; and
22 (2) making any payments to the District of Columbia, as specified in this
23 title.
24 [(b)] (C) [The] EACH service rate:
25 (1) shall be chargeable against all properties IN A CLASS for a connection
26 with any line owned by the Commission;
27 (2) shall be uniform FOR THE CLASS throughout the sanitary district; and
28 (3) may be changed as necessary.
29 (D) THE COMMISSION MAY ESTABLISH ONE OR MORE CUSTOMER CLASSES
30 FOR ANY SERVICE RATE OR CHARGE ESTABLISHED UNDER THIS TITLE.
31 25–502.

4 HOUSE BILL 1168
1 (a) (1) Except as provided in this subtitle, [the] EACH service rate for water
2 shall consist of:
3 (i) a minimum or a ready to serve charge, WHICH MAY INCLUDE
4 AN INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT COMPONENT; and
5 (ii) a charge for water used.
6 (2) (I) The minimum or ready to serve charge [shall] MAY be based on
7 the size of the meter on the water connection leading to [the] A property OR ON OTHER
8 CRITERIA DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS THE COMMISSION
9 ADOPTS.
10 (II) THE COMMISSION MAY CREATE CUSTOMER CLASSES
11 WITHIN ANY METER SIZE FOR THE MINIMUM OR READY TO SERVE CHARGE.
12 (3) The charge for water used shall be based on the amount of water
13 passing the meter during the period between the last two readings.
14 (4) The meter shall be placed on each water connection by and at the
15 expense of the Commission.
