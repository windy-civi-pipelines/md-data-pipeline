in this Act are not law and may not be considered to have been enacted as part of this Act.
SECTION 3. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the provisions of this Act are
intended solely to correct technical errors in the law and there is no intent to revive or
otherwise affect law that is the subject of other acts, whether those acts were signed by the
Governor prior to or after the signing of this Act.
SECTION 4. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the publishers of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, subject to the approval of the Department of Legislative
Services, shall make any changes in the text of the Annotated Code necessary to effectuate

or will take effect prior to October 1, 2025. Any enactment of the 2025 Session of the General
Assembly that negates or extends the effect of a previously enacted termination provision
shall prevail over the provisions of this section.
SECTION 5. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That the publishers of the
Annotated Code of Maryland, in consultation with and subject to the approval of the
Department of Legislative Services, shall make nonsubstantive corrections to codification,
style, capitalization, punctuation, grammar, spelling, and any reference rendered incorrect
or obsolete by an Act of the General Assembly, with no further action required by the
General Assembly. The publishers shall adequately describe any such correction in an
editor’s note following the section affected.
SECTION 6. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act is an emergency
measure, is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public health or safety, has
been passed by a yea and nay vote supported by three–fifths of all the members elected to
each of the two Houses of the General Assembly, and shall take effect from the date it is
enacted.
