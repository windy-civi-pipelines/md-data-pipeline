AN ACT concerning
Public Safety – Fuel Gas Piping Systems and Corrugated Stainless Steel Tubing
for Fuel Gas Piping Systems – Requirements and Prohibitions – Prohibitions
and Study
FOR the purpose of prohibiting the sale, offer for sale, transfer, or distribution of
nonconductive non–arc–resistant jacketed corrugated stainless steel tubing that does
not meet certain qualifications; requiring certain tubing used; establishing a certain
civil penalty for a person who uses certain tubing in the construction of fuel gas
piping systems in certain buildings to meet certain qualifications; requiring the
Maryland Department of Labor, in collaboration with the State Fire Prevention
Commission, and the Office of the State Fire Marshal, and local inspectors, to
conduct a study and make recommendations regarding corrugated stainless steel
tubing and other fuel gas piping systems related to preventing the fire hazards
associated with commonly used fuel gas piping systems, including gas piping and
corrugated stainless steel tubing, in residential and commercial buildings; and
generally relating to fuel gas piping systems, gas piping, and corrugated stainless
steel tubing.
