2025 Session
HB0982
Gun Theft Felony Act of 2025
Bill Summary
This bill (1) excludes theft of a firearm from the general theft statute; (2) classifies theft of a firearm
as a separate felony offense; and (3) establishes penalties for theft of a firearm.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
Under current law, penalties for gun theft are provided under the general theft statute and vary
based on the value of the stolen property. The bill removes gun theft from the general theft statute
and alters the penalties applicable to theft of a firearm. Demographic data specific to gun theft is
not readily available to measure specific impacts. Data on general larceny-theft arrests from 2023,
however, indicates some disparity between Black offenders and offenders of other races. This
limited data suggests that the bill’s provisions have the potential to exacerbate racial disparities
that currently exist in the State’s criminal justice system. Additional data on the racial and ethnic
distribution of the individuals charged and/or convicted of firearm thefts would be required to
measure the specific impacts of the bill.
Analysis
This bill establishes and alters penalties under § 7-104 of the Criminal Law Article for theft of a
firearm. A person convicted of theft of a firearm, including an antique firearm or a replica of an
antique firearm, is guilty of a felony and subject to the following penalties: (1) for a first
conviction, a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine; and (2) for a second
or subsequent conviction, a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a $2,500 fine. A
sentence imposed for theft of a firearm under the bill must be separate from and consecutive to a
sentence imposed for any other offense.
HB 982/ Page 1

Larceny-theft is the unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the
possession or constructive possession of another person. Under existing law, theft of a firearm is
subject to the general theft statute, which imposes penalties based on the value of the stolen
property or services. Generally, theft of an item that is less than $1,500 in value is a misdemeanor.
Depending on the value of the property stolen and whether a defendant has prior convictions, the
maximum penalty for misdemeanor theft is up to five years imprisonment and/or a $5,000 fine.
Changing crimes from misdemeanors to felonies means that (1) such cases are likely to be filed in
the circuit courts rather than the District Court and (2) some persons may eventually serve longer
incarcerations due to more stringent penalty provisions applicable to some offenses for prior felony
convictions.
Uniform Crime Reporting in Maryland
The Department of State Police (DSP) crime reporting program is currently in the process of
moving from its current reporting system to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) National
Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). Effective January 1, 2021, the FBI mandated this
change in crime reporting from the existing Summary Reporting System (SRS) to NIBRS. The
move to NIBRS is designed to improve the quality and quantity of crime data collected by law
enforcement agencies. As of November 15, 2024, most law enforcement agencies in Maryland
have completed the transition to NIBRS. This includes all primary agencies (county police/sheriff)
in 22 counties and Baltimore City. The 2023 data cited in this note reflects 20 SRS reporting
agencies with the remaining agencies reporting using NIBRS.
The available DSP arrest data suggest that Black individuals are consistently overrepresented in
the larceny arrest data when compared to their overall share of the State’s population. During 2023,
a total of 1,595 larceny-thefts and 296 arrests were reported through SRS. As shown in Exhibit 1,
while Black individuals account for only 29% of the State population, 47% of the arrestees were
Black. Of the remaining arrestees, approximately 52% were white, slightly higher than the overall
white population in the State. Asian, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or
Other Pacific Islander individuals accounted for less than 1% of arrestees.
NIBRS reporting agencies reported 87,710 larceny-thefts and 8,617 arrests. Black and white
arrestees comprised 55% and 43%, respectively, of the total arrestees. Asian, American Indian or
Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander individuals accounted for just over
2% of total arrestees.
While there are no data readily available that specifically document firearm thefts, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives noted that in 2023 193 registered firearms
were reported stolen or lost by federal firearms licensees in Maryland.

Conclusion
The statewide racial and ethnic demographics of individuals arrested for larceny-theft crimes, as
reported by Maryland law enforcement agencies, suggest racial disproportionality exists for Black
individuals for larceny-theft arrests generally, but no data is readily available to measure inequities
related specifically to gun theft charges, arrests, and convictions. Thus, the exact magnitude of this
bill’s potential impacts on racial equity cannot be fully measured without additional historical and
comprehensive data on the racial and ethnic distribution of firearm thefts.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest single race
demographic group in the State of Maryland comprising 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national population, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
