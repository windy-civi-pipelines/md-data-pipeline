1 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal

14 official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the

1 landlord in all costs and damages mentioned in the judgment, and other damages as shall

7 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for

28 the court on the day stated in the summons, the court may continue the case to a day not
29 less than 6 [nor] DAYS OR more than 10 days after the day first stated and notify the

34 is fully ended and expired, that due notice to quit as aforesaid had been given to the tenant
35 or person in possession and that the tenant or person in possession had refused so to do,
36 the court shall [thereupon] give judgment for the restitution of the possession of said
37 premises and shall forthwith issue its warrant to the sheriff or a constable in the respective

10 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
11 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall
12 so hold over, then the tenant or person in possession of said premises may retain possession
13 thereof until the determination of said appeal.
14 (iv) The appellate court shall, [upon] ON application of either party,
15 set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days

17 party or that party’s counsel at least 5 days before the hearing.
18 (v) If the judgment of the District Court shall be in favor of the
19 landlord, a warrant shall be issued by the appellate court to the sheriff, who shall proceed

26 for a stated term provides that the landlord may repossess the premises prior to the
27 expiration of the stated term if the tenant breaches the lease, the landlord may make

29 1. The tenant breaches the lease;
30 2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written
31 notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the
32 leased premises; or
33 B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a
34 person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
35 imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
36 the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property

6 SENATE BILL 442
1 and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that

5 refuses to comply.
6 (ii) The court shall summons immediately the tenant or person in

10 cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons
11 conspicuously on the property.
12 (ii) After notice is sent to the tenant or person in possession by

15 (3) If either of the parties fails to appear before the court on the day stated
16 in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
17 more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
18 (b) (1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease
19 and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give
20 judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the
21 sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full
22 and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
23 was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
24 possession.

28 conditioned [upon] ON diligent prosecution of the appeal; (iii) pays all rent in arrears, all
29 court costs in the case; and (iv) pays all losses or damages which the landlord may suffer

38 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.

SENATE BILL 442 7

3 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
4 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
5 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of

8 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
9 paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant
