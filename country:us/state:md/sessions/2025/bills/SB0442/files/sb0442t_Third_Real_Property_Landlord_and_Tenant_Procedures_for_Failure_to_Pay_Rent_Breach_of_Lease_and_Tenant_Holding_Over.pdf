2 SENATE BILL 442
1 Preamble
2 WHEREAS, Failing to provide a tenant with reasonable notice and an opportunity
3 to reclaim their personal belongings after of an eviction is inconsistent with human dignity
4 and human rights and creates an increased potential for violent confrontations on eviction;
5 and
6 WHEREAS, Landlords should not be burdened with removing a tenant’s personal
7 belongings and placing them into public view immediately on eviction of the tenant; and
8 WHEREAS, Neighborhoods benefit from having a tenant’s personal belongings
9 safely stored rather than becoming a source of blight in the community; now, therefore,
10 SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
11 That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
12 Article – Real Property
13 8–401.

17 the order within 7 days, the court shall, at any time after the expiration of the 7 days, issue
18 its warrant, directed to any official of the county entitled to serve process, ordering the
19 official to cause the landlord to have again and repossess the property by putting the
20 landlord, or the landlord’s duly qualified agent or attorney, in possession of the property[,
21 and for that purpose to remove from the property, by force if necessary, all the furniture,
22 implements, tools, goods, effects or other chattels of every description whatsoever belonging
23 to the tenant, or to any person claiming or holding by or under the tenant].
24 (ii) If the landlord does not order a warrant of restitution within 60
25 days from the later of the date of judgment or the expiration date of any stay of execution:
26 1. The judgment for possession shall be stricken; and
27 2. The judgment shall be applied to the number of judgments
28 necessary to foreclose a tenant’s right to redemption of the leased premises as established

30 the judgment may not apply for purposes of subsection [(g)(2)] (H)(2) of this section.
31 (iii) If the landlord orders a warrant of restitution but takes no action
32 on the warrant within 60 days from the later of the date the court issues the order for the

8 be incurred and sustained by reason of the appeal.
9 (3) The bond shall not affect in any manner the right of the landlord to

13 (b) (1) (i) Subject to § 8–406 of this subtitle and where any tenancy is for

18 appellate court and all loss or damage which the landlord may suffer by reason of the
19 tenant’s holding over, including the value of the premises during the time the tenant shall

21 thereof until the determination of said appeal.
22 (iv) The appellate court shall, [upon] ON application of either party,
23 set a day for the hearing of the appeal, not less than 5 [nor] DAYS OR more than 15 days

1 2. A. The landlord has given the tenant 30 days’ written
2 notice that the tenant is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to repossess the
3 leased premises; or
4 B. The breach of the lease involves behavior by a tenant or a
5 person who is on the property with the tenant’s consent, which demonstrates a clear and
6 imminent danger of the tenant or person doing serious harm to themselves, other tenants,
7 the landlord, the landlord’s property or representatives, or any other person on the property
8 and the landlord has given the tenant or person in possession 14 days’ written notice that
9 the tenant or person in possession is in violation of the lease and the landlord desires to

12 refuses to comply.

17 cannot be found, the constable or sheriff shall affix an attested copy of the summons
18 conspicuously on the property.

23 in the summons, the court may continue the case for not less than [six nor] 6 DAYS OR
24 more than 10 days and notify the parties of the continuance.
25 (b) (1) If the court determines that the tenant breached the terms of the lease
26 and that the breach was substantial and warrants an eviction, the court shall give
27 judgment for the restitution of the possession of the premises and issue its warrant to the
28 sheriff or a constable commanding the tenant to deliver possession to the landlord in as full
29 and ample manner as the landlord was possessed of the same at the time when the lease
30 was entered into. The court shall give judgment for costs against the tenant or person in
31 possession.

35 conditioned [upon] ON diligent prosecution of the appeal; (iii) pays all rent in arrears, all
36 court costs in the case; and (iv) pays all losses or damages which the landlord may suffer

7 EXECUTED IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF § 8–407 OF THIS SUBTITLE.

10 unless the parties specifically otherwise agree in writing.
11 (2) Any payment accepted shall be first applied to the rent or the
12 equivalent of rent apportioned to the date that the landlord actually recovers possession of
13 the premises, then to court costs, including court awarded damages and legal fees and then
14 to any loss of rent caused by the breach of lease.
15 (3) Any payment which is accepted in excess of the rent referred to in
16 paragraph (2) of this subsection shall not bear interest but will be returned to the tenant
