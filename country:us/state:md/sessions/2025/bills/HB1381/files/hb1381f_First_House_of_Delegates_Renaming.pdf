16 during the term of my acting as ..................
17 Article II – Executive Department
18 2.
19 An election for Governor and Lieutenant Governor, under this Constitution, shall be
20 held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November, in the year nineteen hundred
21 and seventy–four, and on the same day and month in every fourth year thereafter, at the
22 places of voting for [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES to the General Assembly; and every
23 person qualified to vote for [Delegate] REPRESENTATIVE, shall be qualified and entitled
24 to vote for Governor and Lieutenant Governor; the election to be held in the same manner
25 as the election of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES, and the returns thereof, under seal, to
26 be addressed to the Speaker of the House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES, and enclosed
27 and transmitted to the Secretary of State, and delivered to said Speaker, at the
28 commencement of the session of the General Assembly, next ensuing said election.
29 3.
30 The Speaker of the House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES shall then open the
31 said Returns, in the presence of both Houses; and the persons having the highest number
32 of votes for these offices, and being constitutionally eligible, shall be the Governor and
33 Lieutenant Governor, and shall qualify, in the manner herein prescribed, on the third
34 Wednesday of January next ensuing [his] THE election OF THE GOVERNOR AND
35 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, or as soon thereafter as may be practicable.
36 4.

HOUSE BILL 1381 3
1 If two or more sets of persons shall have the highest and equal number of votes for
2 Governor and Lieutenant Governor, one set of them shall be chosen Governor and
3 Lieutenant Governor, by the Senate and House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES; and
4 all questions in relation to the eligibility of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, and to the
5 Returns of said election, and to the number and legality of votes therein given, shall be
6 determined by the House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES; and if the person having the
7 highest number of votes for Governor or for Lieutenant Governor or both of them, be
8 ineligible, a person or persons shall be chosen by the Senate and House of [Delegates]
9 REPRESENTATIVES in place of the ineligible person or persons. Every election of Governor
10 or of Lieutenant Governor, or both, by the General Assembly shall be determined by a joint
11 majority of the Senate and House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES; and the vote shall
12 be taken viva voce. But if two or more sets of persons shall have the highest and an equal
13 number of votes, then, a second vote shall be taken, which shall be confined to the sets of
14 persons having an equal number; and if the vote should again be equal, then the election
15 of Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be determined by lot between those sets, who
16 shall have the highest and an equal number on the first vote.
17 17.
18 (a) To guard against hasty or partial legislation and encroachment of the
19 Legislative Department upon the co–ordinate Executive and Judicial Departments, every
20 Bill passed by the House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES and the Senate, before it
21 becomes a law, shall be presented to the Governor of the State. If the Governor approves
22 the Bill, the Governor shall sign the Bill. Except for the Budget Bill, if the Governor
23 disapproves the Bill, the Governor shall return it with objections to the House in which it
24 originated, which House shall enter the objections at large on its Journal and proceed to
25 reconsider the Bill. Each House may adopt by rule a veto calendar procedure that permits
26 Bills that are to be reconsidered to be read and voted upon as a single group. The members
27 of each House shall be afforded reasonable notice of the Bills to be placed on each veto
28 calendar. Upon the objection of a member, any Bill shall be removed from the veto calendar.
29 If, after such reconsideration, three–fifths of the members elected to that House pass the
30 Bill, it shall be sent with the objections to the other House, by which it shall likewise be
31 reconsidered, and if it passes by three–fifths of the members elected to that House it shall
32 become a law. The votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and nays, and the
33 names of the persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each
34 House respectively.
35 (b) If any Bill presented to the Governor while the General Assembly is in session
36 is not returned by the Governor with objections within six days (Sundays excepted), the
37 Bill shall be a law in like manner as if the Governor signed it, unless the General Assembly,
38 by adjournment, prevents its return, in which case it shall not be a law.
39 (c) Any Bill presented to the Governor within six days (Sundays excepted), prior
40 to adjournment of any session of the General Assembly, or after such adjournment, shall
41 become law without the Governor’s signature unless it is vetoed by the Governor within 30
42 days after its presentment.

4 HOUSE BILL 1381
1 (d) Any Bill, except the Budget Bill, vetoed by the Governor shall be returned to
2 the House in which it originated immediately after the House has organized at the next
3 regular or special session of the General Assembly, other than in extraordinary session
4 convened under subsection (g) of this section. The Bill may then be reconsidered according
5 to the procedure specified in this section. Any Bill enacted over the veto of the Governor, or
6 any Bill which shall become law as the result of the failure of the Governor to act within
7 the time specified, shall take effect 30 days after the Governor’s veto is over–ridden, or on
8 the date specified in the Bill, whichever is later. If the Bill is an emergency measure, it
9 shall take effect when enacted. No such vetoed Bill shall be returned to the Legislature
10 when a new General Assembly of Maryland has been elected and sworn since the passage
11 of the vetoed Bill.
12 (e) Except for the Budget Bill, the Governor shall have power to disapprove of any
13 item or items of any Bills making appropriations of money embracing distinct items, and
14 the part or parts of the Bill approved shall be the law, and the item or items of
15 appropriations disapproved shall be void unless repassed according to the rules or
16 limitations prescribed for the passage of other Bills over the Executive veto.
17 (f) (1) The Governor may approve or disapprove items in the Budget Bill as
18 provided in this subsection.
19 (2) The Governor may veto only items relating to the Executive
20 Department that have been increased or added by the General Assembly. The Governor
21 may not veto any other items in the Budget Bill.
22 (3) If the Governor vetoes an item that had been increased by the General
23 Assembly and the General Assembly does not override the veto under subsection (g) of this
24 section, that item shall revert to the proposed appropriation submitted by the Governor.
25 The proposed appropriation shall then be law immediately without further action by the
26 Governor.
27 (4) If the Governor vetoes an item that had been added by the General
28 Assembly and the General Assembly does not override the veto under subsection (g) of this
29 section, that item shall be void.
30 (5) Items not disapproved by the Governor shall be law immediately
31 without further action by the Governor.
32 (g) (1) If the Governor vetoes an item in the Budget Bill, the General Assembly
33 may convene in extraordinary session within 30 days after the date of the veto to consider
34 whether to override the veto. If the General Assembly wishes to consider whether to
35 override the Governor’s veto of an item in the Budget Bill, the President of the Senate and
36 the Speaker of the House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES jointly shall issue a
37 proclamation specifying the date on which to convene in extraordinary session.

HOUSE BILL 1381 5
1 (2) (i) The Budget Bill shall be returned by the Governor to the House
2 in which it originated, and each vetoed item shall be considered individually.
3 (ii) If three–fifths of the members elected to that House vote to
4 override the veto of an item, it shall be sent to the other House for consideration.
5 (iii) If three–fifths of the members of that House vote to override the
6 veto of the item, that item shall revert to the appropriation originally passed by the General
7 Assembly. The appropriation as originally passed shall then become law immediately,
8 without further action by the Governor or the General Assembly.
9 21A.
10 (a) The salaries of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be as provided in
11 this section.
12 (b) The Governor’s Salary Commission is created. It consists of seven members:
13 The State Treasurer; three appointed by the President of the Senate; and three appointed
14 by the Speaker of the House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES. Members of the General
15 Assembly and officers and employees of the State or a political subdivision of the State are
16 not eligible for appointment to the Commission. The members of the Commission shall elect
17 a member to be chairman, and the concurrence of at least five members is required for any
18 formal Commission action. The terms of members shall be for 4 years, except that the
19 persons first appointed to the Commission shall serve from June 1, 1977 until May 31,
20 1980. The members of the Commission are eligible for reappointment. Members shall serve
21 without compensation but shall be reimbursed for expenses incurred in carrying out
22 responsibilities under this section.
23 (c) Within ten days after the commencement of the regular session of the General
24 Assembly in 1978, and within ten days after the commencement of the regular session of
25 the General Assembly each fourth year thereafter, the Commission shall make a written
26 recommendation to the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and other members of the General
27 Assembly as to the salary of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.
28 (d) The recommendation shall be introduced as a joint resolution in each House
29 of the General Assembly not later than the fifteenth day of the session. The General
30 Assembly may amend the joint resolution to decrease the recommended salaries, but may
31 not amend the joint resolution to increase the recommended salaries. If the General
32 Assembly fails to adopt a joint resolution in accordance with this section within 50 days
33 after its introduction, the salaries recommended by the Commission shall apply. If the
34 General Assembly amends the joint resolution in accordance with this section, the salaries
35 specified in the joint resolution, as amended, shall apply. If the Commission recommends
36 no salary change, a joint resolution shall not be introduced.
37 (e) The Commission may not recommend salaries lower than that received by the
38 incumbent Governor at the time the recommendation is made; and the General Assembly

6 HOUSE BILL 1381

5 ensuing term of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor.

24 the Journal.
25 24.
26 The House of [Delegates] REPRESENTATIVES may inquire, on the oath of
27 witnesses, into all complaints, grievances and offenses, as the Grand Inquest of the State,
28 and may commit any person, for any crime, to the public jail, there to remain, until

30 relating either to the collection or expenditure of the revenue, and appoint auditors to state
31 and adjust the same. They may call for all public, or official papers and records, and send
32 for persons, whom they may judge necessary in the course of their inquiries, concerning
33 affairs relating to the public interest, and may direct all office bonds which shall be made
