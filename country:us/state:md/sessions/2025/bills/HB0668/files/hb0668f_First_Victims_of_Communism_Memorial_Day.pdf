2 HOUSE BILL 668
1 WHEREAS, President Trump declared November 7, 2017, a National Day for the
2 Victims of Communism, condemning communism as a political philosophy “incompatible
3 with liberty, prosperity, and the dignity of human life”; and
4 WHEREAS, The bipartisan U.S. Congressional Caucus for the Victims of
5 Communism stated publicly in 2018 that “Marx’s defenders often say he cannot be held
6 accountable for what communist regimes did long after his life and death; but Marxist
7 dictators who massacred their own people were applying communist ideology to political
8 practice”; and
9 WHEREAS, Communist regimes worldwide have killed more than 100 million
10 people and subjected countless others to the worst and widest–spread human rights abuses
11 known to history, with victims representing many different human ethnicities, creeds, and
12 backgrounds; and
13 WHEREAS, Through false promises of equality and liberation, communist regimes
14 have as a matter of government policy robbed their own citizens of the rights of freedom of
15 religion, freedom of speech, and freedom of association through coercion, brutality, and fear;
16 and
17 WHEREAS, Many victims of communism were persecuted as political prisoners for
18 speaking out against these regimes, and others were killed in genocidal, state–sponsored
19 purges; and
20 WHEREAS, In addition to violating basic human rights, communist regimes have
21 suppressed freedom of conscience, cultural life, and self–determination movements in more
22 than 40 nations; and
23 WHEREAS, The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, D.C.,
24 is a nonprofit organization, authorized by unanimous Act of the U.S. Congress, that
25 educates people about the ideology, history, and legacy of communism and honors the
26 people who have suffered and died under communist regimes; now, therefore,
