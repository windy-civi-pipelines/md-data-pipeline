maintenance organizations to include certain discounts, financial assistance
payments, product vouchers, and other out–of–pocket expenses made by or on behalf
of an insured or enrollee when calculating certain cost–sharing contributions for
certain prescription drugs; requiring certain persons that provide certain discounts,
financial assistance payments, product vouchers, or other out–of–pocket expenses to
notify an insured or enrollee of certain information and to provide a certain statement
to the insured or enrollee; prohibiting certain insurers, nonprofit health service plans,
and health maintenance organizations from setting, altering, implementing, or
conditioning the terms of certain coverage based on the availability or amount of
financial or product assistance available for a prescription drug; providing that a
violation of a certain provision of this Act is considered a violation of the Consumer

certain cost sharing amounts paid by or on behalf of an enrollee or a beneficiary when
calculating the enrollee’s or beneficiary’s contribution to a cost sharing requirement
for certain health care services; requiring administrators, carriers, and pharmacy
benefits managers to include certain cost sharing amounts for providing that the
calculation requirement does not apply to enrollees in certain high–deductible health
plans after an enrollee or a beneficiary satisfies a certain requirement; prohibiting
administrators, carriers, and pharmacy benefits managers from directly or indirectly
setting, altering, implementing, or conditioning the terms of certain coverage based
on certain information; requiring third parties that pay certain financial assistance
to provide certain notification to an enrollee and prohibiting the third parties from
conditioning the assistance on the enrollee taking certain actions; and generally

BY adding to
Article – Insurance
Section 15–118.1 and 15–1611.3
Annotated Code of Maryland
(2017 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
Preamble
WHEREAS, Cost sharing assistance is indispensable in helping many patients with
rare, serious, and chronic diseases afford out–of–pocket costs for their essential and often
life–saving medications; and
– 1 –

Ch. 692 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
WHEREAS, Patients need cost sharing assistance because of the high out–of–pocket
costs for their prescription medications; and
WHEREAS, When patients face unexpected charges during their health benefit plan
year, they are less likely to adhere to their medication regimen; and
WHEREAS, Lack of patient adherence to needed medications leads to potential
negative health consequences such as unnecessary emergency room visits, doctors’ visits,
surgeries, and other interventions; and
WHEREAS, Patients are able to use cost sharing assistance only after they have met
requirements for coverage for their medication, including the medication’s inclusion on the
patient’s formulary and utilization management protocols, such as prior authorization and
step therapy; and
WHEREAS, Health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers have implemented
programs, such as accumulator adjustment programs, to restrict cost sharing assistance
from counting toward a patient’s deductible or annual out–of–pocket limit; and
WHEREAS, Because of accumulator adjustment programs, patients are required to
continue to make payments even after they have reached their annual out–of–pocket limit,
forcing them to pay their full deductible and annual out–of–pocket limit twice and denying
them the benefit from these programs while increasing the financial burden they bear to
access their life–saving medication; and
WHEREAS, Patients often are not aware of the inclusion of accumulator adjustment
programs in their health plan contracts and tend to learn about these types of programs
when they attempt to obtain their medication after their cost sharing assistance has run
out, whether at the pharmacy, at the infusion center, or at home through the mail; and
WHEREAS, Accumulator adjustment programs allow health insurers and pharmacy
benefits managers to “double dip” by accepting funds from both the cost sharing assistance
program and the patient, beyond the original deductible amount and the annual
out–of–pocket limit; and
WHEREAS, It is a matter of public interest to require health insurers and pharmacy
benefits managers to count any amount paid by the patient or on behalf of the patient by
another person toward the patient’s annual out–of–pocket limit and any cost sharing
requirement, such as deductibles; now, therefore,
SECTION 1. BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF MARYLAND,
That the Laws of Maryland read as follows:
