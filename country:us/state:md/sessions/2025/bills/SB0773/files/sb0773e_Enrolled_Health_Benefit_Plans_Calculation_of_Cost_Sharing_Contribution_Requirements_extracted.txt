16 Section 15–118.1 and 15–1611.3
17 Annotated Code of Maryland
18 (2017 Replacement Volume and 2024 Supplement)
19 Preamble
20 WHEREAS, Cost sharing assistance is indispensable in helping many patients with
21 rare, serious, and chronic diseases afford out–of–pocket costs for their essential and often
22 life–saving medications; and
23 WHEREAS, Patients need cost sharing assistance because of the high out–of–pocket
24 costs for their prescription medications; and
25 WHEREAS, When patients face unexpected charges during their health benefit plan
26 year, they are less likely to adhere to their medication regimen; and
27 WHEREAS, Lack of patient adherence to needed medications leads to potential
28 negative health consequences such as unnecessary emergency room visits, doctors’ visits,
29 surgeries, and other interventions; and
30 WHEREAS, Patients are able to use cost sharing assistance only after they have met
31 requirements for coverage for their medication, including the medication’s inclusion on the
32 patient’s formulary and utilization management protocols, such as prior authorization and
33 step therapy; and
34 WHEREAS, Health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers have implemented
35 programs, such as accumulator adjustment programs, to restrict cost sharing assistance
36 from counting toward a patient’s deductible or annual out–of–pocket limit; and
37 WHEREAS, Because of accumulator adjustment programs, patients are required to
38 continue to make payments even after they have reached their annual out–of–pocket limit,
SENATE BILL 773 3
1 forcing them to pay their full deductible and annual out–of–pocket limit twice and denying
2 them the benefit from these programs while increasing the financial burden they bear to
3 access their life–saving medication; and
4 WHEREAS, Patients often are not aware of the inclusion of accumulator adjustment
5 programs in their health plan contracts and tend to learn about these types of programs
6 when they attempt to obtain their medication after their cost sharing assistance has run
7 out, whether at the pharmacy, at the infusion center, or at home through the mail; and
8 WHEREAS, Accumulator adjustment programs allow health insurers and pharmacy
9 benefits managers to “double dip” by accepting funds from both the cost sharing assistance
10 program and the patient, beyond the original deductible amount and the annual
11 out–of–pocket limit; and
12 WHEREAS, It is a matter of public interest to require health insurers and pharmacy
13 benefits managers to count any amount paid by the patient or on behalf of the patient by
14 another person toward the patient’s annual out–of–pocket limit and any cost sharing
15 requirement, such as deductibles; now, therefore,
