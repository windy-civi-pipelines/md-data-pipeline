19 Preamble
20 WHEREAS, Cost sharing assistance is indispensable in helping many patients with
21 rare, serious, and chronic diseases afford out–of–pocket costs for their essential and often
22 life–saving medications; and
23 WHEREAS, Patients need cost sharing assistance because of the high out–of–pocket
24 costs for their prescription medications; and
25 WHEREAS, When patients face unexpected charges during their health benefit plan
26 year, they are less likely to adhere to their medication regimen; and
EXPLANATION: CAPITALS INDICATE MATTER ADDED TO EXISTING LAW.

2 SENATE BILL 773
1 WHEREAS, Lack of patient adherence to needed medications leads to potential
2 negative health consequences such as unnecessary emergency room visits, doctors’ visits,
3 surgeries, and other interventions; and
4 WHEREAS, Patients are able to use cost sharing assistance only after they have met
5 requirements for coverage for their medication, including the medication’s inclusion on the
6 patient’s formulary and utilization management protocols, such as prior authorization and
7 step therapy; and
8 WHEREAS, Health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers have implemented
9 programs, such as accumulator adjustment programs, to restrict cost sharing assistance
10 from counting toward a patient’s deductible or annual out–of–pocket limit; and
11 WHEREAS, Because of accumulator adjustment programs, patients are required to
12 continue to make payments even after they have reached their annual out–of–pocket limit,
13 forcing them to pay their full deductible and annual out–of–pocket limit twice and denying
14 them the benefit from these programs while increasing the financial burden they bear to
15 access their life–saving medication; and
16 WHEREAS, Patients often are not aware of the inclusion of accumulator adjustment
17 programs in their health plan contracts and tend to learn about these types of programs
18 when they attempt to obtain their medication after their cost sharing assistance has run
19 out, whether at the pharmacy, at the infusion center, or at home through the mail; and
20 WHEREAS, Accumulator adjustment programs allow health insurers and pharmacy
21 benefits managers to “double dip” by accepting funds from both the cost sharing assistance
22 program and the patient, beyond the original deductible amount and the annual
23 out–of–pocket limit; and
24 WHEREAS, It is a matter of public interest to require health insurers and pharmacy
25 benefits managers to count any amount paid by the patient or on behalf of the patient by
26 another person toward the patient’s annual out–of–pocket limit and any cost sharing
27 requirement, such as deductibles; now, therefore,
