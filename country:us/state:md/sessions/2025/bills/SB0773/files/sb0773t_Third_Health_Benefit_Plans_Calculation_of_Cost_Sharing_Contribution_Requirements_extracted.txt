2 SENATE BILL 773
1 WHEREAS, Cost sharing assistance is indispensable in helping many patients with
2 rare, serious, and chronic diseases afford out–of–pocket costs for their essential and often
3 life–saving medications; and
4 WHEREAS, Patients need cost sharing assistance because of the high out–of–pocket
5 costs for their prescription medications; and
6 WHEREAS, When patients face unexpected charges during their health benefit plan
7 year, they are less likely to adhere to their medication regimen; and
8 WHEREAS, Lack of patient adherence to needed medications leads to potential
9 negative health consequences such as unnecessary emergency room visits, doctors’ visits,
10 surgeries, and other interventions; and
11 WHEREAS, Patients are able to use cost sharing assistance only after they have met
12 requirements for coverage for their medication, including the medication’s inclusion on the
13 patient’s formulary and utilization management protocols, such as prior authorization and
14 step therapy; and
15 WHEREAS, Health insurers and pharmacy benefits managers have implemented
16 programs, such as accumulator adjustment programs, to restrict cost sharing assistance
17 from counting toward a patient’s deductible or annual out–of–pocket limit; and
18 WHEREAS, Because of accumulator adjustment programs, patients are required to
19 continue to make payments even after they have reached their annual out–of–pocket limit,
20 forcing them to pay their full deductible and annual out–of–pocket limit twice and denying
21 them the benefit from these programs while increasing the financial burden they bear to
22 access their life–saving medication; and
23 WHEREAS, Patients often are not aware of the inclusion of accumulator adjustment
24 programs in their health plan contracts and tend to learn about these types of programs
25 when they attempt to obtain their medication after their cost sharing assistance has run
26 out, whether at the pharmacy, at the infusion center, or at home through the mail; and
27 WHEREAS, Accumulator adjustment programs allow health insurers and pharmacy
28 benefits managers to “double dip” by accepting funds from both the cost sharing assistance
29 program and the patient, beyond the original deductible amount and the annual
30 out–of–pocket limit; and
31 WHEREAS, It is a matter of public interest to require health insurers and pharmacy
32 benefits managers to count any amount paid by the patient or on behalf of the patient by
33 another person toward the patient’s annual out–of–pocket limit and any cost sharing
34 requirement, such as deductibles; now, therefore,
