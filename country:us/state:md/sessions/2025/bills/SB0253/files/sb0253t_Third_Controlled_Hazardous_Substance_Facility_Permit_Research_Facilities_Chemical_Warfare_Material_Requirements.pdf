6 have the meanings indicated.
7 (b) (1) “Chemical warfare material” means any of the following:
8 (i) Adamsite (Phenarsazine chloride);
9 (ii) GA (Ethyl–N, N–dimethyl phosphoramidocyanidate);
10 (iii) GB (Isopropyl methyl phosphonofluoridate);
11 (iv) GD (Pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate);
12 (v) H, HD (Bis(2–chloroethyl) sulfide);

20 warfare material as an active or principal ingredient or ingredients, and degradation
21 products of chemical warfare material.
22 (c) (1) “Monitoring data” means data from actual stack emissions under all

SENATE BILL 253 3
1 7–239.2.
2 (a) The State of Maryland finds that the chemical warfare materials specified
3 under § 7–239.1 of this subtitle were designed for warfare, specifically the destruction of
4 human beings, and for no legitimate civilian industrial use.
5 (b) The State recognizes the need to dispose of these chemical warfare materials
6 as safely as possible, ensuring the health and safety of State residents by the regulation of
7 their release into the environment.
8 (c) Since these chemical warfare materials are highly toxic or carcinogenic, in
9 addition to any other applicable requirements at law, the State shall require [without
10 exemption or waiver] that an applicant for the treatment by incineration of chemical
11 warfare materials shall comply with all [the] APPLICABLE requirements of this subtitle
12 and all APPLICABLE regulations adopted under this subtitle.
13 (D) NOTHING IN THIS SECTION OR IN §§ 7–239.3 AND 7–239.4 THROUGH
14 7–239.5 OF THIS SUBTITLE SHALL LIMIT THE AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT TO
15 APPLY REGULATIONS ADOPTED UNDER THIS SUBTITLE TO A CHEMICAL WARFARE
16 MATERIAL THAT IS A CONTROLLED HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE.
17 7–239.3.
18 (A) THIS SECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO THE INCINERATION OF CHEMICAL
19 WARFARE MATERIALS AT A RESEARCH FACILITY IF THE INCINERATION IS DONE FOR
20 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, OR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES.
21 [(a)] (B) A chemical warfare material that is a solid waste is a controlled
22 hazardous substance.
23 [(b)] (C) (1) SUBJECT TO § 7–239.5 OF THIS SUBTITLE, THIS
24 SUBSECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO THE INCINERATION OF CHEMICAL WARFARE
25 MATERIALS AT A RESEARCH FACILITY IF THE INCINERATION IS DONE FOR
26 RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, OR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES.
27 (2) In addition to any other applicable requirements, the Department may
28 not issue a permit for the construction, material alteration, or operation of a controlled
29 hazardous substance facility to be used for the treatment by incineration of a chemical
30 warfare material unless:
31 (1) (I) The permit applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
32 Department prior to issuance of a controlled hazardous substance facility permit:
33 (i) 1. That the proposed incinerator technology has consistently
34 met all applicable federal and State performance standards in an operational facility

4 SENATE BILL 253
1 comparable to the proposed facility for a period of time and under conditions acceptable to
2 the Department;
3 (ii) 2. That emissions and monitoring data from a comparable
4 facility demonstrate compliance with State toxic air pollutant standards established under
5 Title 2 of this article;
6 (iii) 3. That a destruction and removal efficiency of 99.9999
7 percent is achievable for each chemical warfare material to be incinerated at the facility;
8 (iv) 4. That the applicant has made adequate provision to
9 support and fund the development of a plan that demonstrates the capability of removing,
10 sheltering, and protecting persons from the largest area at risk from a worst–case release,
11 as defined by the Department;
12 (v) 5. That an emergency preparedness plan has been developed
13 with adequate public participation that provides training, coordination, and equipment
14 necessary for State and local emergency response personnel and community members to
15 respond to a release of a chemical warfare material from the proposed facility; and
16 (vi) 6. That the emergency preparedness plan has been
17 presented at public meetings in each county potentially impacted by a worst–case release;
18 (2) (II) The Department finds that the applicant has fully evaluated all
19 reasonable alternative methods for treatment or disposal including transport to a less
20 populated disposal site in order to create less risk of release or harm to the general public
21 or the environment; and
22 (3) (III) The local governing body of each county and municipal
23 corporation included in the worst–case release has a reasonable opportunity to review and
24 provide comment on the facility permit application and the emergency preparedness plan
25 under paragraph (1)(v) of this subsection ITEM (I)5 OF THIS PARAGRAPH.
26 7–239.4.
27 (A) THIS SUBJECT TO § 7–239.5 OF THIS SUBTITLE, THIS SECTION DOES NOT
28 APPLY TO THE INCINERATION OF CHEMICAL WARFARE MATERIALS AT A RESEARCH
29 FACILITY IF THE INCINERATION IS DONE FOR RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, OR
30 DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES.
31 [(a)] (B) The Department shall require as conditions of operation of a controlled

10 to be destroyed.
11 [(c)] (D) After destruction of the specific quantity of the controlled hazardous
12 substance allowed by the terms of the permit issued under this section, the incinerator shall
13 be disassembled and disposed of in accordance with all applicable federal and State
14 performance standards and in a time period established by the permit.
15 [(d)] (E) In addition to the facility permit fee required under § 7–237 of this
16 subtitle, the applicant shall pay the compensation of an independent third party with whom
17 the Department may contract for the review of application materials and monitoring data.
