AN ACT concerning
Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection Commission – Established
FOR the purpose of establishing the Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection
Commission to monitor and assess the impact of potential and actual federal changes
to specified health care programs and to provide recommendations for State and local
action to protect the access of residents of the State to affordable health coverage;
and generally relating to the Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection
Commission.
Preamble
WHEREAS, The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) has
enabled more than 600,000 Maryland residents to gain access to quality and affordable
health insurance coverage since its implementation, with the State’s uninsured rate
dropping from approximately 11% in 2010 to approximately 6% in 2024; and
WHEREAS, Approximately 6% of Maryland residents remain uninsured, with
disparities in coverage rates particularly affecting communities of color and low–income
households; and
WHEREAS, Changes to the ACA, the federal Mental Health Parity and Addiction
Equity Act (MHPAEA), Medicaid, or Medicare could significantly impact health care access
and affordability for Maryland residents; and
WHEREAS, It is estimated that a repeal of the ACA may result in over 30 million
individuals becoming uninsured in the United States; and
WHEREAS, In Maryland, more than 600,000 people may become uninsured in the
aftermath of a repeal of the ACA; and
WHEREAS, Millions of American seniors, including thousands of Maryland seniors,
could incur substantially higher health care costs following a repeal or weakening of the
ACA or Medicare; and
WHEREAS, Recent federal policy changes and market dynamics have created
uncertainty in the health care landscape, potentially affecting the stability of Maryland’s
insurance markets and health care delivery systems; and
WHEREAS, The COVID–19 pandemic highlighted the critical importance of
maintaining robust health care infrastructure and ensuring widespread access to
affordable health coverage; and
