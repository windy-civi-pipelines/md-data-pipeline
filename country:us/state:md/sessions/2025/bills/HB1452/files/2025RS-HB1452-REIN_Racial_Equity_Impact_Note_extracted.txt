HB1452
Hate Bias Incident
Bill Summary
This bill (1) alters the definition of “sexual orientation” applicable to the protected classes under
specified hate crime statutes and (2) alters hate crimes-related reporting requirements for the
Department of State Police (DSP).
Racial Equity Impact Statement
State law requires DSP to report annually on hate bias incidents in Maryland. The bill’s provisions
would expand reporting of hate crimes and noncriminal hate bias incidents in the State. The
additional data reporting will provide a clearer picture of hate bias in the State to the benefit of law
enforcement, policymakers, and individuals affected by hate crime or hate bias incidents.
Analysis
The bill alters the definition of “sexual orientation” as defined in Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal
Law Article. Currently, “sexual orientation” means the identification of an individual as to male
or female homosexuality, heterosexuality, or bisexuality. As proposed by the bill, “sexual
orientation” is defined to mean an individual’s identity, or other’s perception of an individual’s
identity, in relation to the gender or genders to which the individual is sexually or emotionally
attracted. “Sexual orientation” does not mean gender identity.
The bill defines a hate bias incident as an act of hostility or aggression that (1) is directed at an
individual or a group, private property, or public property; (2) is motivated, in whole or
HB 1452/ Page 1
substantially in part, by another individual’s or g roup’s actual or perceived protected class status,
as specified; and (3) does not constitute a crime under State or federal law.
The bill specifically includes the following acts as hate bias incidents: (1) slurs, name-calling, and
insults; (2) the display of material with offensive language, symbols, or threats targeting a
protected class on private property; (3) the posting of material with offensive language, symbols,
or threats targeting a protected class that does not result in property damage; (4) electronic and
online distribution of material with offensive language, symbols, or threats targeting a protected
class; and (5) distribution of materials with messages using offensive language, symbols, or threats
targeting a protected class in a public place.
Under existing law, the hate crime statute identifies members of a protected class and prohibits
specified actions by a person if motivated in whole or in substantial part by another person’s or
group’s race, color, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, disability, national
origin, or homelessness.
Hate Crime and Hate Bias Incident Reporting
Title 2, Subtitle 3 of the Public Safety Article requires the collection of data on hate crimes as well
as noncriminal hate bias incidents, so both criminal conduct and noncriminal incidents of hate bias
are combined in the report. According to DSP, crime-based data in the report pertains to hate
bias-related crimes, which are recorded as hate or bias incidents but, more specifically, involve
offenses that can result in arrests. Hate crime definitions often encompass not only violence against
individuals or groups, but also crimes against property, such as arson or vandalism, particularly
those directed against community centers or houses of worship.
Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention
Chapter 773 of 2023 established the Commission on Hate Crime Response and Prevention to
develop strategies to prevent and respond to hate crime activity and evaluate State laws and
policies relating to hate crimes. The commission must report to the State Department of Education
on policy recommendations to address hate crimes that occur in schools and to the General
Assembly on legislative recommendations to address hate crimes in the State. The bill’s provisions
are adapted from the commission’s recommendations in its 2024 annual report to address and more
clearly define a hate bias incident and to incorporate the present-day understanding of how
diversely people experience sexual orientation beyond the three identities described in the existing
statute.
Hate Bias Incidents in Maryland
In Maryland, there were a total of 951 hate bias incidents reported by law enforcement during
2023; of those, 270 reports were verified. It should be noted that some incidents are not clearly
identified as hate bias, but investigative efforts may reveal an incident is hate bias motivated.
Depending on the outcome of this follow-up investigation, hate bias incidents are classified as
verified, inconclusive, or unfounded. Exhibit 1 shows the breakdown of reported incidents by bias
motivation category. Of these reported incidents, race/ethnicity/ancestry (R/E/A) is the largest
category, accounting for 52.6% of reported incidents. Specifically, anti-Black and anti-Jewish
motivated incidents accounted for just over 64% of all incidents. Religion-based hate bias
HB 1452/ Page 2
motivations increased from 20.7% in 2022 to 31. 5% in 2023. Vandalism and verbal intimidations
were the largest categories of crime or incidents underlying individual reports.

Conclusion
Hate bias incident prevention and response has significant equity implications. There is not
sufficient data to analyze the exact nature of the bill’s impacts, but it is probable that the expanded
definitions and reporting of the hate bias incidents under the bill will assist stakeholders and
members of the public in ascertaining a more complete picture of how certain groups/identities are
affected by hate bias in Maryland.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
