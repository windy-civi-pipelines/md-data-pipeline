development charge imposed by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission for

by which the county councils establish eligibility for the exemptions; prohibiting the
county councils from requiring that an applicant for an exemption for a property
located in Montgomery County own the property for which the exemption is sought;
requiring Montgomery County to approve applications for the exemptions on a
first–come, first–served basis until a certain maximum annual limit is reached; and
generally relating to the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and
exemptions from the system development charge.
