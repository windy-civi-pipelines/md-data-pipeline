6 last predeceased spouse; or
7 B. the last predeceased spouse died before January 1, 2019,
8 and no Maryland estate tax return was required to be filed with respect to the predeceased
9 spouse’s estate.

22 Comptroller may examine a Maryland estate tax return of a predeceased spouse after the
23 time for assessing a tax under this title has expired under § 13–1101 of this article solely
24 for the purposes of determining the validity of the deceased spousal unused exclusion
25 election and the amount to be taken into account under paragraph (3) of this subsection.

27 assessment of any additional tax with respect to the predeceased spouse’s Maryland estate
