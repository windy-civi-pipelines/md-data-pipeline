3 Article – Public Utilities
4 7–306.2.
5 (a) (1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.
6 (4) “Community solar energy generating system” means a solar energy
7 system that:
8 (i) is connected to the electric distribution grid serving the State;
9 (ii) [is located in the same electric service territory as its subscribers;
10 (iii)] is attached to the electric meter of a subscriber or is a separate
11 facility with its own electric meter;
12 [(iv)] (III) credits its generated electricity, or the value of its
13 generated electricity, to the bills of the subscribers to that system through virtual net
14 energy metering;
15 [(v)] (IV) has at least two subscribers but no limit to the maximum
16 number of subscribers;
17 [(vi)] (V) does not have subscriptions larger than 200 kilowatts
18 constituting more than 60% of its kilowatt–hour output;
19 [(vii)] (VI) has a generating capacity that does not exceed 5
20 megawatts as measured by the alternating current rating of the system’s inverter;
21 [(viii)] (VII) may be owned by any person; and
22 [(ix)] (VIII) with respect to community solar energy generating
23 systems constructed under the Program, serves at least 40% of its kilowatt–hour output to
24 LMI subscribers unless the solar energy system is wholly owned by the subscribers to the
25 solar energy system.
26 (7) “LMI subscriber” means a subscriber that:
27 (i) is low–income;
28 (ii) is moderate–income; or
29 (iii) resides in a census tract that is an:

8 200% of the federal poverty level.
9 (9) “Moderate–income” means having an annual household income that is
10 at or below 80% of the median income for Maryland.
11 (12) “Program” means the Community Solar Energy Generating Systems
12 Program.
13 (14) “Subscriber” means a retail customer of an electric company that:
14 (i) holds a subscription to a community solar energy generating
15 system; and
16 (ii) has identified one or more individual meters or accounts to which
17 the subscription shall be attributed.
18 (b) The General Assembly finds that:
19 (1) community solar energy generating systems:
20 (i) provide residents and businesses, including those that lease
21 property, increased access to local solar electricity while encouraging private investment in
22 solar resources;
23 (ii) enhance continued diversification of the State’s energy resource
24 mix to achieve the State’s renewable energy portfolio standard and Greenhouse Gas
25 Emissions Reduction Act goals; and
26 (iii) provide electric companies and ratepayers the opportunity to
27 realize the many benefits associated with distributed energy; and
28 (2) it is in the public interest that the State enable the development and

4 SENATE BILL 1022
1 (i) allow renters and low–income and moderate–income retail
2 electric customers to own an interest in a community solar energy generating system;
3 (ii) facilitate market entry for all potential subscribers while giving
4 priority to subscribers who are the most sensitive to market barriers; and
5 (iii) encourage developers to promote participation by renters and
6 low–income and moderate–income retail electric customers.
7 (c) A community solar energy generating system, subscriber, subscriber
8 organization, or subscription coordinator is not:
9 (1) an electric company;
10 (2) an electricity supplier; or
11 (3) a generating station if the generating capacity of the community solar

15 (ii) The structure of the Program is as provided in this subsection.
16 (2) All rate classes may participate in the Program.
17 (3) (I) Subscribers served by electric standard offer service, community
18 choice aggregators, and electricity suppliers may hold subscriptions to the same community
19 solar energy generating system.
20 (II) 1. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSUBPARAGRAPH 2 OF
21 THIS SUBPARAGRAPH, A SUBSCRIBER MUST RESIDE IN THE SAME ELECTRIC
22 SERVICE TERRITORY AS THE COMMUNITY SOLAR ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM TO
23 WHICH THE SUBSCRIBER HOLDS A SUBSCRIPTION.
24 2. AN LMI SUBSCRIBER MAY HOLD A SUBSCRIPTION TO
25 A COMMUNITY SOLAR ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM LOCATED IN A DIFFERENT
26 ELECTRIC SERVICE TERRITORY THAN THE ONE IN WHICH THE LMI SUBSCRIBER
27 RESIDES.
28 (j) (2) (i) This paragraph applies to electric companies, electric
29 cooperatives, and municipal utilities that participate in the Program.
30 (ii) A subscriber who has a change in the service address associated

10 RESIDES IN THE SAME ELECTRIC SERVICE TERRITORY AS THE COMMUNITY SOLAR
11 ENERGY GENERATING SYSTEM.
12 (2) BY ORDER OR REGULATION, THE COMMISSION SHALL ESTABLISH
13 A PROCESS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF COMMUNITY SOLAR BILL CREDITS BETWEEN
