22 RELIEF AND DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT IS NECESSARY, THE
23 PREVAILING MEMBER SHALL BE AWARDED ALL COSTS OF SUCH LITIGATION,
24 INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES. THE REMEDIES HEREIN SHALL NOT BE
25 THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES OF THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION MAY PURSUE

22 IN FURTHERANCE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COMPACT
