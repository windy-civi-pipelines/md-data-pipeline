Section 1:
2025 Session
HB0441
Court
Bill Summary
This bill authorizes a court to transfer a minor convicted as an adult to the juvenile court for
sentencing if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that the individual against
whom the minor is convicted of committing the offense previously committed a sex crime (under
Title 3, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article) or human trafficking (under Title 3, Subtitle 11 of
the Criminal Law Article) against the minor within three months before the offense for which the
minor was convicted. If a juvenile (the minor) is transferred to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court,
the juvenile court must make a juvenile disposition.
Racial Equity Impact Statement
The bill’s provisions requiring juveniles convicted as adults to be sentenced in juvenile court, in
cases where they have perpetrated a violent crime against a person that has sexually abused or
trafficked them, may reduce the severity of their sentence after conviction. This may impact Black
defendants to the greatest extent as they are significantly overrepresented in the population of
youth charged as adults. In addition, there is some evidence that Black youth are disproportionately
exposed to general child abuse/maltreatment, and potentially sexual abuse. Data is not readily
available to measure the specific impacts, but they would depend on the proportion of defendants
that meet the bill’s criteria.
Analysis
The bill requires that a minor convicted as an adult be transferred to juvenile court and receive a
juvenile disposition if the person against whom the minor’s crime was committed violated sex

crime and/or human trafficking statutes against t he convicted minor within three months prior to
the minor’s crime. Under existing law, the juvenile court does not have jurisdiction over children
at least age 16 who are alleged to have committed specified violent crimes, children age 14 and
older charged with a crime punishable by life imprisonment, and children who have previously
been convicted as an adult of a felony and are subsequently alleged to have committed an act that
would be a felony if committed by an adult. Juveniles meeting the criteria above are treated as
adults and moved to the circuit court except in limited circumstances where a circuit court transfers
the case to the juvenile court (reverse waiver).
The bill removes the circuit court’s discretion and requires a reverse waiver when there is clear
and convincing evidence that the juvenile convicted as an adult had been victimized by their
accuser. Qualifying crimes include rape, sexual offenses, incest, and sexual solicitation of a
minor/human trafficking.
Impacts of the Bill
According to the Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), 443 juveniles were arrested and charged
as adults in the State in 2023. Exhibit 1 shows that more than 80% of these youths identified as
Black compared to their 31% proportion of the overall State population aged 11 to 18.

Being charged as an adult subjects these youths to the potential collateral consequences of an adult
conviction. Generally speaking, the adverse consequences of having a criminal record – especially
as a juvenile – can last beyond imprisonment, fines, and the legal process and can include the
denial of civil opportunities and benefits available to a person due to their record. Specifically,
having a criminal history can adversely affect employment prospects which can further influence
an individual’s level of income, housing opportunities, and access to quality health care.
In addition, as shown in Exhibit 2, 34.7% of child abuse victims in 2022 were Black, according
to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This compares to 24.5% of child abuse
victims that were white. Victims of child abuse include those experiencing sexual abuse, which
accounted for 31% of all child abuse cases in 2022.

Conclusion
The bill’s provisions could minimize harsh sentences and the concomitant potential of some youth
in this category being exposed to the collateral consequences of criminal conviction later in life.
By removing defendants to the juvenile court for sentencing, the bill provides the opportunity for
rehabilitative outcomes since a multitude of treatment programs would be available to covered
youth. In particular, the DJS Trauma Informed Care program, a rehabilitative approach that takes
into account past trauma and how it affects behavior, is designed to help youth address their

reactions to trauma triggers. Black juveniles are li kely to benefit the most under the bill as they are
significantly overrepresented in adult transfers to the circuit court. Data also suggests that Black
youth may also be disproportionately exposed to the types of sexual abuse that would allow them
to instead be sentenced in the juvenile court. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of the effect
on juveniles covered under the bill without additional demographic and longitudinal data regarding
this subgroup.

Appendix – Maryland Demographics
Race and Ethnicity of the Maryland Population
Maryland’s 2020 census population is 6,177,244, a 7% increase from the 2010 census count and
approximately 2% higher than the 2019 census population estimates. In addition to an increase in
population, Maryland’s racial demographics have become more diverse. Maryland is now a state
in which racial minorities make up a majority of its total population. Notable changes relevant to
this shift are the increase in groups who identify as “other” and “multiracial” (i.e., two or more
racial identities), which total 5% of the State’s population. Additionally, the change in
demographics is due to the decrease in the number of individuals who only report “white” as their
racial group. Despite this decrease, non-Hispanic whites remain the largest race demographic
group in the State at 47% of the State’s population.
Compared to the U.S. population overall, Maryland’s population of individuals who identify as a
single race is more diverse. Maryland is ranked as the fourth most diverse state by the U.S. Census
Bureau’s Diversity Index. As shown in Exhibit 1, in Maryland, 47% identify as white alone
compared to 58% of the national population. Similarly, 51% of the population identify as
non-white or multi-racial compared to 38% of the national population. In both the State and
national populations, the largest shares of the non-white population are individuals who are Black,
with 29% of the State population identifying only as Black and another 2.5% identifying as Black
in combination with some other race. Maryland’s Asian population is 7%, which is slightly higher
than the Asian share of the national population of 6%. The State’s overall population by ethnicity,
however, is slightly less diverse than the U.S. population; 12% of the State’s population identified
as Hispanic or Latino compared to 19% of the U.S. population.
