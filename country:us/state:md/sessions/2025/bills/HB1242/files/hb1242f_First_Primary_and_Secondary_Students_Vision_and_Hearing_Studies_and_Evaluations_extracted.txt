15 recommended eye exams and other vision support treatments and services, the feasibility

15 long–term vision support needs;
16 2. partnering with community providers to provide primary
17 and secondary students with initial vision assessments and treatments and long–term care;
18 and

20 provided to primary and secondary students regardless of insurance status, with
21 consideration given to whether insurance companies can provide annual contributions,
22 capitation, or other methods to underwrite the cost of the programs either in part or in
23 whole.
