participant in full compliance in an employment program approved by the Administration,
or the Administration finds that one of the grounds under subsection (c)(1)(i) of this section
exists, the Administration shall notify the Motor Vehicle Administration to reinstate the
obligor’s license or privilege to drive.

Ch. 578 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND

(ii) The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the
application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case.
(iii) In determining whether the application of the guidelines would
be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court may consider:

order or right to occupy the family home under an agreement, any direct payments made
for the benefit of the children required by agreement or order, or any other financial
considerations set out in an existing separation or property settlement agreement or court
order;
2. the presence in the household of either parent of other
children to whom that parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent
is directly contributing; and
3. whether an obligor’s monthly child support obligation
would leave the obligor with a monthly actual income below 110% of the 2019 federal
poverty level for an individual.
(iv) The presumption may not be rebutted solely on the basis of
evidence of the presence in the household of either parent of other children to whom that
parent owes a duty of support and the expenses for whom that parent is directly
contributing.
(v) 1. If the court determines that the application of the
guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, the court shall make a
written finding or specific finding on the record stating the reasons for departing from the
guidelines.
2. The court’s finding shall state:
A. the amount of child support that would have been required
under the guidelines;
B. how the order varies from the guidelines;
C. how the finding serves the best interests of the child; and
D. in cases in which items of value are conveyed instead of a
portion of the support presumed under the guidelines, the estimated value of the items
conveyed.
(B) AFTER ESTABLISHING A CHILD SUPPORT ORDER, THE COURT SHALL
SEND A COPY OF THE GUIDELINE CALCULATION AND THE ORDER TO THE CHILD
SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION.
[(b)] (C) (1) The court may decline to establish a child support order if the
parent who would have the obligation to pay child support:
(i) lives with the child who would be the subject of the child support
order and is contributing to the support of the child; or
– 5 –

Ch. 578 2025 LAWS OF MARYLAND
(ii) 1. is unemployed;
2. has no financial resources from which to pay child support;
and
3. A. is incarcerated and is expected to remain
incarcerated for the remainder of the time that the parent would have a legal duty to
support the child;
B. is institutionalized in a psychiatric care facility and is
expected to remain institutionalized for the remainder of the time that the parent would
have a legal duty to support the child;
C. is totally and permanently disabled, is unable to obtain or
maintain employment, and has no income other than Supplemental Security Income or
Social Security disability insurance benefits; or
D. is unable to obtain or maintain employment in the
foreseeable future due to compliance with criminal detainment, hospitalization, or a
rehabilitation treatment plan.
(2) The fact that a parent meets or ceases to meet the criteria described in
paragraph (1) of this subsection shall constitute a material change of circumstance for the
purpose of a modification of a child support award.
[(c)] (D) The adoption or revision of the guidelines set forth in this subtitle is not
a material change of circumstance for the purpose of a modification of a child support
award.
[(d)] (E) On or before January 1, 1993, and at least every 4 years after that date,
the Child Support Administration of the Department of Human Services shall:
(1) review the guidelines set forth in this subtitle to ensure that the
