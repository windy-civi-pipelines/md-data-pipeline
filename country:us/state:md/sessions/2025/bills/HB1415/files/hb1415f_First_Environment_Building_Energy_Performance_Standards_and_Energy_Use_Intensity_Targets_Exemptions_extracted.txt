17 (2) Engages in commercial cooking and water heating.
18 (F) THE DEPARTMENT MAY NOT REQUIRE A COVERED BUILDING THAT
19 RECEIVED A USE AND OCCUPANCY PERMIT BEFORE JUNE 1, 2022, TO COMPLY WITH
20 BUILDING ENERGY PERFORMANCE STANDARDS DEVELOPED UNDER OR ENERGY USE
21 INTENSITY TARGETS ADOPTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS SECTION UNTIL IT
22 BECOMES NECESSARY TO REPLACE LIGHTING SYSTEMS, HEATING, VENTILATING,
23 AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) SYSTEMS, OR OTHER MAJOR COMPONENTS OF THE

25 OF THE END OF LIFE OF THOSE COMPONENTS.
26 SECTION 2. AND BE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act shall take effect
